    "Worked in medium sized company. Signed an NDA. Nick is giving you the sauce. Watch till it’s internalized.",
    "One of the few channels that gives their full thought process on getting from A-B... You are not click-baiting, but instead giving us the real roadmap. Thanks Nick!",
    "Love it! As Theodore Levitt did put it: “People don’t want to buy a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole!”",
    "Nick, thanks for the great encouragement and information. As a technologist providing solutions for many years, you hit the nail on the head, you gotta consult to get to the solution. Seems like customers used to come to me for fixing their problems in the past, now they are empowered with information and ability and I have to work a lot harder to get involved in solving their problems. This information is great to help get there.",
    "excellent presentation. I appreciate how you always bring the AI Tech value into real life business practices. It's interesting to see your continual evolution and that of others who started in the AAA space with a focus on builds and progressed into solving business problems to deliver real value.",
    "Thank you!!! As a former dev, these tips help me get out of old habits. I did create an interactive version of this so that it's more fun for me to use :)",
    "Nick i'd like you to make a masterclass of prompt engineering with GPT5, as I think prompt engineering is one of the most important skills nowadays. Thank You!!",
    "Loved the driver tree example where Aar automated lead enrichment to boost sales efficiency-do you think a similar automation could streamline job applications or responses to vacancies?",
    "Awsome this is amazing how did u get in to start working with them and how is it possible u get to work with all of them in such short time",
    "Nick, what's the real difference between MAKER SCHOOL VS MMWM ?? I would like to understand why you consider the value to be priced higher than just Maker School. Thanks!",
    "hey Nick I remembered you had 2 communities in school, did you shut 1 down and just focus on maker school? Thank you for the valuable video, it has helped me think very clearly and get to 20K MRR",
    "I have been on the other side of Big 4 consulting many times. That's the BS they tell you. That's not the business they are really in. All of that is smoke and mirrors from their real business strategies. Ask yourself what business are they really in. It's not producing results for businesses.",
    "How do you even know all this in the first place? WHO taught you that?",
    "Yo great video man. do you have a discord server that I could join"
