  "content": "Humans rule Earth without competition. But we are  about to create something that may change that: our last invention, the most powerful  tool, weapon, or maybe even entity: Artificial Super intelligence. This sounds like  science fiction, so let’s start at the beginning. Intelligence is the ability to learn, reason,  acquire knowledge and skills and use them to solve problems. Intelligence is power, and  we’re the species that exploited it the most. So much so that humanity broke  the game of nature and took control. But the journey there wasn’t straightforward.  For most animals intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it. Still, if we track  intelligence in the tree of species over time, we can see lots of diverse  forms of intelligence emerge. The earliest brains were in flatworms 500  million years ago. Just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions.  It took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more  complex. Life conquered new environments, gained new senses and had to contend  with fierce competition over resources. But in nature all that matters is survival  and brains are expensive, so for almost all animals a narrow intelligence, fit for a narrow  range of tasks was enough. In some environments, animals like birds, octopuses and mammals evolved  more complex neural structures. For them it paid off to have more energy-consuming skills  like advanced navigation and communication. Until seven million years ago, the  Hominins emerged. We don’t know why, but their brains grew faster than  their relatives’. Something was different about their intelligence –  very slowly, it turned from narrow, to general. From a screwdriver to a multi  tool. Able to think about diverse problems. Two million years ago, Homo Erectus  saw the world differently from anyone before – as something to be understood  and transformed. They controlled fire, invented tools and created the first culture. We probably emerged from them around 250,000  years ago with an even larger and more complex brain. It enabled us to work together in large  groups and to communicate complex thoughts. We used our intelligence to improve our lives,  to ask how things worked and why things are the way they are. With each discovery, we  asked more questions and pushed forward, preserving what we learned, outpacing  what evolution could do with genes. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Progress was  slow at first and then sped up exponentially. Agriculture, writing, medicine,  astronomy or philosophy exploded into the world. 200 years ago science  took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up  progress. 35 years ago the internet age began. Today we live in a world made to  suit our needs, created by us, for us. This is incredibly new. We forget how hard it  was to get here. How enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were and how long  it took to climb them. But once we did, we became the most powerful animal  in the world in a heartbeat. But we may be in the process of changing this.  We are building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to  conquer the planet. Humanity's final invention. Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence, or AI, is  software that performs mental tasks with a computer. Code that uses silicon,  instead of neurons, to solve problems. In the beginning, AI was very simple. Lines  of code on paper, mere proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform  mental tasks. Only in the 1960s did we start seeing the first examples of what we  would recognize as AI. A chatbot in 1964, a program to sort through molecules in 1965. Slow,  specialised systems requiring experts to use them. Their intelligence was extremely narrow, built  for a single task inside a controlled environment. The equivalent of flatworms a billion years  ago, doing the minimum amount of mental work. Progress in AI research paused several times when  researchers lost hope in the technology. But just like changing environments create new niches for  life, the world around AI changed. Between 1950 and 2000 computers got a billion times faster,  while programming became easier and widespread. In 1972, AI could navigate a room.  In 1989, it could read handwritten numbers. But it remained a fancy tool,  no match for humans! Until in 1997 an AI shocked the world by beating the world  champion in Chess. Proving that we could build machines that could surpass us –  but we calmed ourselves because a chess bot is quite stupid. Not a flatworm, but maybe  a bee, only able to perform a specialised, narrow task. But in this narrow task it is so good  that no human will ever again beat AI at chess. As computers continued to improve, AI became  a powerful tool for more and more task: in 2004 it drove a robot on Mars, in 2011  it began recommending Youtube videos to you. But this was only possible  because humans broke down problems into easy-to-digest chunks that  computers could solve quickly. Until we taught AIs to teach themselves. Rise of the Self-Learning Machines This is not a technical video, so we are  massively oversimplifying here. In a nutshell, the sheer power of supercomputers was combined  with the almost endless data collected in the information age to make a new generation of AI. AI experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neural networks,  enormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their  tasks. They then used machine learning, which is an umbrella term for many different  training techniques and environments, that allows algorithms to write their own  code and improve themselves. The scary thing is that we don’t exactly know how they do it  and what happens inside them. Just that it works and that what comes out the other end is  a new type of AI. A capable black box of code. These new AIs could master  complex skills extremely quickly, with much less human help. They were still  narrow intelligences, but a huge step up. In 2014, Facebook AI could identify faces with  97% accuracy. In 2016 an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of Go. In 2018,  a self-learning AI learned chess in four hours just by playing against itself – and then  defeated the best specialised chess bot. Since then machine learning has been applied to  reading, image processing, solving tests and much more. Many of these AIs are already better than  humans for whatever narrow task they were trained, but they still remained a simple tool. AI still  didn’t seem that big of a deal for most people. And then came the chatbot ChatGPT. The work  that went into it is massive. It trained on nearly everything written on the Internet to learn  how to handle language, which it now does better than most people. It can summarise, translate and  help with some maths problems. It is incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years  ago, not crushing any single benchmark but all of them at once. Many large tech companies are  spending billions to build powerful competitors. AI is already transforming customer service,  banking, healthcare, marketing, copywriting, creative spaces and more. AI-generated content  has already taken hold of social media, youtube and news websites. Elections are expected to  be inundated by propaganda and misinformation. No-one is sure how much good or harm  can come from adopting AI everywhere. Change is scary. There will be winners  and losers. One of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to  manage the transition to an AI-boosted economy. All these potential gains or risks  are just the result of today’s AI. ChatGPT’s intelligence is a major step  up, but it remains narrow. While it can write a great essay in seconds, it  doesn’t understand what it is writing. But what if the AIs stopped being narrow? General AI What makes humans different from current  AI is our general intelligence. Humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge  and start working on any problem. We are great at many very different skills and  tasks, from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles – not equally  of course. Some of us are experts in some fields and beginners in others,  but we can technically do all of them. In the past AI was narrow and able  to become good at one skill but was rather bad in all the others. Simply by  building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training will get us  new, more powerful generations of AI. But what if the next step for AI is  to become a general intelligence like us? An AGI? If the AI improvement  process continues as it has been, it is not unlikely that AGI could be better  in most or even all skills than humans can do. We don’t know how to build AGI, how it  will work or what it will be able to do. Since narrow AIs today are capable  of mastering one mental task quickly, AGI might be able to do the same with all  mental tasks. So even if it starts out stupid, an AGI might be able to become  as smart and capable as a human. While this sounds like science fiction, most AI researchers think this will happen some  time this century, maybe already in a few years. Humanity is not ready for what will happen next.  Not socially, not economically, not morally. Earlier we defined Intelligence  as the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills and use them to  solve problems. All things humans excel at. An AGI as intelligent as even an average human  would already disrupt modern civilization, because they are not bound by  the same limitations as we are. Today’s AIs like ChatGPT already think  and solve the tasks they were made for at least ten times faster than even very  skilled humans. Maybe AGI will be slower but it may also be faster, maybe much  faster. And since AGIs are software, you could copy them endlessly as long as you  have enough storage and run them in parallel. There are 8 million scientists in the world – Now  imagine an AGI, copied a million times and put to work. Imagine one million scientists working  24/7, thinking ten times faster than humans, without being distracted, only focused  on the task they have been given. What if suddenly AGI could do all intelligence  based jobs in the world, from interpreting law, to coding to creating animated youtube  videos – better, faster and much cheaper than humans? Would whoever controls  this AGI suddenly own the economy? And thinking bigger: Human progress is our  intelligence applied to problems, so what could a million AGIs achieve? Solve fundamental  questions of science, like dark energy? Invent new technology that gives us limitless energy,  fix climate change, cure ageing and cancer? But then again, sadly humans apply their  intelligence not just for the benefit of all. What if the AGIs are tasked to  guide drones or pull the triggers in war? Or to engineer a virus that only  kills people with green eyes? Or to create the most profitable social media, so addictive  that people starve in front of their screens? The creation of AGI could reasonably  be as big of an event as taming fire or electricity – and give whoever  invents it equally as much power. But now let us go one step further. What  if the potential of AGI does not stop here? Intelligence Explosion Intelligence and knowledge build and accelerate  each other but humans are limited by biology and evolution. Once we evolved the right hardware,  our software outpaced evolution by orders of magnitudes and within a heartbeat we ruled this  planet. But our software basically hasn’t changed much since then, which is why we have obesity  and destroy the climate for short term gains. Since AGI is software on a computer, once  it is smart enough to do AI research, the rate of AI progress should speed up a lot.  And that results in better AI that's better at AI research without much human involvement.  It may even be possible that AI could learn how to directly improve itself, in which case  some experts fear this feedback loop could be incredibly fast. Maybe just months or years  after the first self improving AGI is switched on. Maybe it would actually take decades. We  simply don’t know, this is all speculative. But such an intelligence explosion might  lead to a true superintelligent entity. We don’t know what such a being would look  like, what its motives or goals would be, what would go on in its inner world. We could  be as laughably stupid to a superintelligence as squirrels are to us. Unable to  even comprehend its way of thinking. This hypothetical scenario keeps many people  up at night. Humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than  all others – and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings. AGI might be the last invention of humanity. It is possible that it could  become the most intelligent, and therefore most powerful being on Earth. A  ‘God in a Box’ that could exercise its power to bring unimaginable wealth and happiness to  humans while securing our future. Or, it could subvert civilization and bring about our end, with  humanity unable to come up with a way to stop it. We will look at some of these potential futures  in more videos but let us wrap up now. The only thing we know for sure is that today, right now,  many of the largest and richest companies in the world are racing to create ever more powerful AIs.  Whatever our future is, we are running towards it.
