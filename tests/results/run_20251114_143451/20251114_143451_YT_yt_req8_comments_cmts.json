    "Join Maker School & get AI customer #1 + all my templates https://www.skool.com/makerschool/about?ref=e525fc95e7c346999dcec8e0e870e55d",
    "I’m a college student and acquire my first customer in maker school about a month ago and he still work with me until now. %200 Recommend everyone here to join",
    "Serious amount of value delivered in this video - if you’re ‘on the fence’ and don’t get started after this, you never will Got one small tactic to add to your sales process - whether someone says they do want to go for it, or if they ‘need to think about’ / consult with others - 100% schedule the next call there and then, so it’s in the diary. If they already want in, that can even be later that day / next day - just call it the ‘onboarding’ call, by which time you’ll have the sales agreement setup online ready to sign, and the billing link ready to share, so that you take the payment live on the call… If they need time to consider - still schedule the next call, including any other decision maker involved, and then send the proposal as Nick outlined in the video",
    "Struggled with ads before, but Rumora's comment placements brought in more visibility and clients. Totally worth trying!",
    "Raw value and exceptional ideas no one talks about makes you stand out as a AI Automator youtuber, big fan, soon joining Maker School. Loved your content.",
    "Man I love the value you give out for free. Awesome to see when a s&m funnel actually makes peoples lives better",
    "just wanna say the effort you put into these videos is amazing, all the info and docs you provide is helping me create with ease, look forward to showing you what ive built from your teachings",
    "This video is exactly what I needed. I like the cut of your jib...you always over-deliver.",
    "This is solid for anyone starting an AI consulting business. The step-by-step blueprint with templates and scripts makes it easy to follow and scale, even for complete beginners.",
    "There are only about 2600 people in Nick’s community doing this, and with over 30 million businesses out there, that’s still around 10,000 potential clients each. Landing just 10 of them could already be a game changer.",
    "Solid! . Thank you so much, Nick. You're literally a BIG blessing to everyone in this field .",
    "Thank you. The sales side and whole process of introducing the client to the solution definitely halts me. This video gives clarity and a reminder that sales isn't deceptive, I'm there to make them more money in exchange for a fraction of the profits! Can there be anything more fulfilling?",
    "I do consultancy as a Voice AI Developer, provide them what they type of AI Calling Agent would work best for them, and then build for them. In this field having tech knowledge is a must have to survive.",
    "the only thing I am missing is clients !!! I love this channel",
    "i love it! ive done an Ai Prompt Engeneer Course. im all in",
    "thaks nick! what a gem u share ! keep it up man we need u!",
    "11:22 - is that Thorfinn? lol Great to see him as a business man and not just a viking.",
    "Hey Nick...a couple of questions. 1) Have you done a video on your preferred process for presenting solutions to a client? 2) Do you have a platform(s) that you use for hosting to demo for clients. Thanks ~David. BTW - joining your MakerSkool soon. Can't wait.",
    "Great video! Appreciate the templates! Since you recommend upwork for beginners, perhaps an updated upwork course would be quite valuable",
    "Sir your video is really awesome!!! Please include the 'Bangla' language, then a lots of Bangali will get the benifit... Currently it's becoming very popular in Bangladeshi young generations...",
    "Incredible content, Nick! I love your videos (+1 subscribe :)). About the infra behind this: In the Platform Access part, do you walk the client through the vps aquisition and access? Or you prefer to control the infra by yourself and get a montly payment for that?"
