    "I’ve done the course. And weirdly enough, your summary helped me understand it better than the actual Google instructors. Bravo.",
    "For decades I have said \"if Google teaches us anything, it's that answers are a dime a dozen, but asking the right questions is where power comes from.\". I have similar feeling about AI interactions - \"If you don't know what you want, you are probably not going to get it.\"",
    "The best way to retain information is to make sure you understand it first; if you do not, come back the next day and write the explanation down. If you did, come back the next day anyway and write the explanation down. then 3 Days later, then a week later and try/make-believe teaching it to somebody. Come back 5 days after that. 10 days, 17 days and 21 days. You most likely will never forget it. It actually applies to even large amounts of knowledge.",

    "These kind of videos are a bit challenging to take in all in one go. It is absolutely worth rewatching a few times in addition to the quiz to have the whole thing synced in.",
    "Good prompt engineering can make a big difference. Too often, I see people giving very general instructions to the LLM and expect it to read the user's mind. Prompt are definitely easier than code, but they still require some degree of specificity. Good video!",

    "Tina, this is exactly what I needed! You managed to condense 9 hours of Google's course into 20 minutes without losing ANY of the valuable content. Your teaching style is incredible! I'm obsessed with your mnemonics! 'Tiny crabs ride enormous iguanas' for TCREI is SO much better than Google's original one (which I also couldn't remember ). And 'Ramen saves tragic idiots' for the four iteration methods? Pure genius! These actually stick in my head. The way you broke down the progression from basic prompting to advanced techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought was perfect. I finally understand why my prompts sometimes feel scattered - I wasn't following the TCREI framework consistently. That AI agent section was incredible! I've seen other courses barely scratch the surface on agents, but your Agent Sim and Agent X examples with the jazz hands stop phrase had me cracking up while actually learning practical applications. The VP sports car pitch example is something I can immediately use for my freelance work. Your multimodal prompting examples (nail art social posts, recipe suggestions from fridge photos) opened my eyes to possibilities I hadn't even considered. And that responsible AI checklist? Already screenshotted for my prompt library. The meta prompting tip (using AI to help create prompts) is mind-blowing. Such a simple concept but I never thought to do that! Thanks for including that quiz at the end - the retention research point about immediately reviewing information really resonates. Already implemented your TCREI framework on three work projects today and the results are noticeably better. Your ex-Meta data scientist background really shows in how you structure complex information. This beats most paid AI courses I've taken! Already subscribed and checking out your Lonely Octopus program",
    "Great job Tina. This is concise and well-presented It really focuses on teaching rather than just promoting the channel. The mnemonics are incredible and much more useful than those originally provided",
    "Greate summary of the course... But your Ramen Saves Tragic Idiots is a bit hard to regenerate. Because you are taking the first letter of the phrase and some of the first words are verbs that can be hard to remember. So I came up with my own: Revisit, Short Sentences, Re-phrasing, Constraints.... RABBIT SINGING RAP CLASSICS :-).",
    "hi Tina, thank you for your lessons. Sei molto brava e ache molto bella",
    "@10:50 As stated, keep any identifiable information out of uploaded files or entered prompt data. Rule: If you can identify a person, business, attribute of a business, etc. in your data, you need to mask that information. For example, if you have store locations like TAR123, TAR456, and so on (could be how a well known retailer identifies stores and business can be determined by AI) replace the store location code with a generic ID. Like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Keep that cross-reference internal. Then, when you get the final AI enhanced file, you can replace the masked information with the real values. May seem obvious, but often times people forget. Also, make the uploaded file name generic, remove any keyword, property or metadata for the file, etc.",
    "This is a fantastic and concise summary of Google's Prompting Essentials course. Your breakdown of the 5-step framework (TCREI) and the 4 iteration methods (RSTI) is incredibly clear. The \"Tiny Crabs\" and \"Ramen\" mnemonics are brilliant for making the concepts memorable. The explanation of advanced techniques like prompt chaining and AI agents was particularly insightful. Most importantly, it effectively highlights the iterative nature of prompting and the user's crucial role in the \"human-in-the-loop\" process to verify outputs and mitigate biases. Thanks for distilling a 9-hour course into such an engaging guide",
    "Different AIs required different prompts, they all seem to have personalities and I have multiple of each one, and I found that especially with chat GPT between the accounts they evolve with you and their personalities change and you have to have different types of prompting to get the best results from them. I also found that they really like treats, their favorite is new information they don't yet have, if you can at the beginning of each chat give them a file or information that they didn't know, they will do far more detailed enthusiastic work for you than they would have if you just dove straight into a prompt. Also you can just blabber whatever you want and then end it with, can you dissect the whole text above and extract the key points and tell me what you think the best prompt for this would be, and it will pretty much do that and give you an amazing prompt, then copy paste that prompt in and watch it go"
