I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!!

Context / Input – The information the AI should work with (a passage, data, situation). Constraints / Format – Any rules for the output (word count, style, tone, list, essay). Audience – Who the output is for (kids, experts, general public). At minimum, you only need Task + Context. The others just make results sharper.",
