a fresh Barber Shop shave without having to leave the comfort of your own home visit manscape.com skillup for 20% off plus free shipping click below to check it out or stick around to the end of the video to learn more you guys remember the day before of course you do I mean who could forget one of the most Shameless rug pools in the history of video games it was the survival game that promised everything the graphics the open world the zombies the vehicles the housing the weapon crafting earning it a spot as the most wishlisted game on Steam at one point in time obviously it immediately self-c combusted on launch on account of all of that being complete bollocks but clearly there was demand for a fresh new game packed with all those features and it was a shame to see that we wouldn't be getting it coincidentally on the 6th of December 2023 literally the day before the day before released a game called once human launched into closed beta developed by star studio and published by nety uh there was a lot of Buzz around it at the time as many hoped it' be everything the day before never ended up being it then released about 6 months later to an overall positive reception but in the busyness of last year I ended up missing out on it and never got to see for myself whether it lives up to those expectations but given how much attention this game was getting and that the Play account is still holding quite strong I figured now would be a good time to loop back to it to round out last year's live service Bonanza so I've now played over over 40 hours of once human 6 months after its 1.0 launch how does it fair well while I have some issues with its onboarding experience difficulty and monetization I'm pleased to report that in many ways this does actually deliver a lot of the things that the day before never did it is a survival crafter MMO with an expansive open world packed with zombie like creatures Raiders and military forces that you'll need to fend off to get your loot it's got a remarkably robust housing and crafting system allowing you to fulfill almost any fantasy you'd want in this setting be it a weapon Smith an engineer a chef a farmer but it's actually a bit more than just a feature dense survival crafting game why this really clicked for me in the end is because if it's live service SL lutter shooter twist which I found genuinely well done it's got this creature collecting system and deep gear game alongside an arpg like seasonal model and all of this enables a level of longevity that I've rarely gotten from the survival genre and that's the main draw here with Once human not the fact that it's kind of like the day before if it was an actual functional video game but that it's ostensibly a live service survival crafter and in the words of Mrs Simpson I just think that's neat and sure we've had a lot of live service games lately and survival crafting games are also a dime a dozen but if you're after a game that marries the two you don't have a ton of options to be honest I had every reason to expect that that genre blend would not work that it' lead to a growth confusing experience and as I said it kind of does initially but like pickles and peanut butter somehow these ingredients work well together in the end fun fact I'm actually allergic to peanuts but I've heard that combo tastes pretty good it's a Luda shooter that trades the repetitive Mission structure for the simple yet satisfying survival crafting Loop and it's a survival game that gives you reasons to keep playing long after you've defeated the final boss these elements complement each other surprisingly well so well in fact that had I not been occupied with other live servy games I could totally see myself keeping up with this one over the years to come thank you for that message I went on quite a journey with Once human uh to start allow me to list everything I experienced in the first hour after a remarkably deep character creator I sat through a from software coded opening cutscene woke up in a lab put on a backpack that teleported me to another dimension met a talking bird killed some zombies stepped through some magical doors then I got wared to some place that looked straight out of a remedy game watched some vague flashbacks killed a dude with a briefcase for a head proceeded to grab his briefcase head with telekinesis powers that I then used to shoot some other dudes after that I got warped to some house in another world met this girl captured this origami butterfly chopped some trees and mined some rocks then defended the house house from a giant monster with a phone tower for a head I walked back through the door of the house only to be warped somewhere else sending me falling from the sky so then I used the bird to Glide down fortnite style then finally pick a spot to set up base camp before being walked through the game's building and crafting mechanics safe to say my first impression was not good at all to say that I was overwhelmed would be an understatement and that feeling was not at all helped by the game constantly bombarding me with tutorials combined with the UI in general taking up so much screen space it was every bit the hellish mix of live service systems and survival crafter mechanics that I feared and I braced myself for the worst for the next 10 or so hours I remained unimpressed the story despite having some surprisingly decent voice acting and interesting World building wasn't really grabbing me there are very few characters to latch on to as you have given just a few blunt conversations with most of them before you shuttled into the next Zone it sticks to a very sing song Gameplay structure as well where you rock up to a town the town's leader tells you there a monster causing grief in the region so you follow some Clues and kill a ghostly version of it activate some Towers then fight the real version of it repeat a lackluster story is nothing new for life service games and I mean having a story at all is rare for a survival game but I do wish once human took better advantage of its dark strange setting to set up some truly captivating Mysteries during all this I realized that enemies were just completely trivial they took forever to notice me they move very slow die quickly don't deal a lot of damage themselves like the first major boss in the game was level 20 and at level 10 half his level I was able to absolutely demolish him by just unloading shotgun rounds into him while straing in a big circle with combat this easy I found it very hard to care about any of the stuff I was collecting and that really soured that entire early game experience come to find out that the server I was put into by default is a novice server and that meant that everything was apparently tuned down I only realized this after completing my playthrough though as the game doesn't make this explicitly clear there probably should have been some immediate indication that there are servers with varying difficulties alas all that's to say that if you have literally any experience with Shooters you should pick one of the hard mode servers as I found them significantly more enjoyable from the jump more on that later so yeah the first 10 hours were pretty rough and unimpressive uh but beyond that I was starting to enjoy myself and by the 20h hour mark it had all really clicked together I started to run into armed Bandits and military forces who could actually deal damage especially because I sort of kept myself underleveled and it's here that I was finally able to appreciate the combat which is fundamentally quite solid this is a third person game but you can aim in first person by tapping the right click instead of holding it which I thought was neat you've got a melee light and heavy attack and a Dodge roll that can be controlled mid roll making it feel exceptionally smooth to use the simple yet satisfying survival crafter Loop was also in full swing at this point I was getting into the rhythm of entering a new Zone looting its towns for scrap and harvesting its materials to craft higher Tier gear that did allow me to push into the next Zone something I appreciated was just how Bountiful resources were each swing at a tree gives you like two dozen logs you get tons of ore from a single node uh and they all respawn within minutes it's kind of silly totally throws off the resource economy but it does make building a grand home far tedious than most other survival crafter games further you can actually relocate your entire home with a single click and it works flawlessly uh unlike in Fallout 76 you've also got this expansive Tech tree that I was finally wrapping my head around and started making my way into a specific discipline I went all in on smelting and weapon smithing but there were many other Pathways I never explored you could get into animal taming and husbandry or work on creating a self-sufficient Fruit Farm or specialize in construction to build an impen Fortress you can refund your Tech points or whatever whenever you want which is very convenient but I think the best way to experiment with this is with the seasonal resets which I'll talk about later I also quite liked the side quests and Ubisoft like map completion that's obviously not everyone's cup of tea so rest assured that it's all optional but if you're in the right head space for it there's quite a Moorish Loop here side quests are pretty simple in terms of gameplay but I liked how they actually lean into the weirdness like this one where I got kidnapped by this clown dude I play Russian roulette with him but he keeps winning by inspecting the area I find the game rigged I convince the clown to let me get some fresh air and then I shoot his accomplice behind the rig before coming back and finally winning on the map completion front uh basically when you rock up to a town or a stronghold you'll have a bunch of objectives on the side to 100% clear it kind of like the Assassin's Creed games you got to kill 10 enemies find two weapon chests find the secret Mystic chest Etc and doing so will reward you with bonus materials combing the area yourself is one way to go about it but there's a fun soulslike element here too in that players can actually leave permanent messages on the ground for other players to read so if you ever find yourself stuck you'll often be able to find someone's message that points out where those chests are and then be on your Merry way so yeah I just found it really satisfying going through the motions and 100% clearing those zones but if you're up the more direct player-to-player interaction uh once humans got you covered there too since this is an always online game and there are public events of all flavors I ran into World boss events horde mode defense missions some that let you even build structures and turrets to help you out and even this PVP one where I had to keep this jellyfish on my head but another player can steal it by killing me again they're pretty basic but varied enough in their objectives to really break up the survival crafter Loop and it's nice to see some actual humans fighting alongside you once in a while since that doesn't happen often in the open world speaking of other players you might have noticed a lack of PVP gameplay in this footage despite being something you'd expect from a game like this well that's because I played on a PVE server and thank goodness I did I haven't heard a single positive thing about PVP in this game from what I understand it's Rife with bugs exploits and imbalance so if that's something you're after I don't know if once human is the game for you it's toward the end game though that I was able to appreciate once human's looter Elements by this point I'd ACR a sizable collection of deviants these are one of the game's more novel features which I can only describe as like a Pokémon style creature collecting system basically the world is overrun by otherworldly creatures and anomalies but some of them are friendly you can find them through side quest or out in the world and once captured you can stick them in a display case at your home base condemning them to a life of servitude as a resource slave or combat companion depending on the deviation one will mine ores for you while you're away another will chop wood this blob guy can be deployed in combat as a sort of healing wall I found another that was literally just a samur I who helps me out on the battlefield and also allows my melee attack to teleport me you can boost their effectiveness by storing them in the right conditions at your base like surrounding them with toys or music or different colored lights they can roll with slightly different appearances and with random perks to increase their capabilities creating quite a compelling Chase akin to that of like shiny hunting in Pokémon and yeah I think their cutesy plush toy aesthetic stands in rather jarring contrast against this setting and I think I would have liked them even more had they been as grotesque and weird as the Hostile ones that you fight but otherwise this is a pretty clever system for injecting some longevity into the game likewise the lutter shooter BuildCraft here is genuinely impressive you can build around critical damage or status effects and combine them with whacky functionality like explosions every few shots or bullets that Ricochet between targets every gear set has impactful build defining bonuses that feed into that play style there's also some Destiny influences like exotic style items that can be equipped to provide a single strong bonus or these seasonal perks that you can equip on your backpack similar to the artifact perks in Destiny there are also collectible mods that can be assigned to each weapon or armor piece each of them randomly rolled with extra secondary stat boosts I honestly didn't expect there to be this much to sink my teeth into but man am I all for it like on my first character I built around the burn status effect so I had a shotgun that had a chance to inflict burn but would also generate these orbs that when picked up would replace my rounds with burning rounds and do more burning damage with every orb I scooped up I complemented this with an assault rifle that causes burning explosions special gloves that cause my Burns to tick faster based on how many burn Stacks were on the target a gear set bonus that causes my Burns to deal more damage if my character's temperature is above a certain threshold which I could manage with consumables and alongside all of that multiple seasonal perks on my backpack including one that further boosts burn damage based on the amount of surrounding enemies inflicted by it I mean that's a lot of moving Parts this amount of equipment Synergy isn't actually something that all lutter Shooters get right and to see it done so well here in a game that doesn't even list itself as a luta shooter but just as a multiplayer survival game that's certainly a surprise very cool to see how you attain this gear is a little less cool though weapons and armor do drop out in the open world in fact there was a moment where I picked up a legendary one and the game automatically opened Wiki to show me possible builds I could make with it which is a welcome feature but unfortunately more often you'll be getting your gear from what is essentially a gacha machine there are a bunch of banners you can pull from You'll Play a mini game of whacka mall to collect your pools there are some other GATRA Style Elements in the game as well like the dozens of reward tabs that give you currencies that need to be exchanged for other currencies and yeah it's all just a complete nightmare to keep track of I do not consider this a gater game though because cruci you cannot actually pay for the gacha currency it is exclusively earned from in-game activities so you cannot pay for power you can also choose to just completely ignore this RNG system and save up your currency to buy the items directly from this shop you cannot max out your gear this way is that requires duplicates and you can only buy each of them once here but it did allow me to complete my desired build without engaging in the RNG stuff that said I think this is just kind of a lame progression model and the game would have been far better off had these drops been rewarded purely from challenging activities but while the gater stuff isn't monetized there is indeed an actual cash shop and it's more or less in line with what you've come to expect from free-to-play games these days though it does go a bit overboard in my opinion it's like 30 Australian dollars minimum for a full outfit or to build your base out of a different kind of wood there's also a premium battle pass and loot boxes so yeah the gatchet progression and MTX kind of sucks but thankfully I've been able to comfort ignore them to end this review on a more positive note though I want to talk about this seasonal model because I think it's one of the key things that really sets this apart from other games in the survival genre do you think you can keep my life typically in a survival game once I've built my dream base and defeated the final boss I can never really find a reason to return or do it all again even something like valheim which I enjoyed a lot and it received a major update some time ago I just didn't feel that compelled to jump back in because I kind of knew what to expect and I already had my fill with the familiar survival crafting Loop but once human has found a way to keep that Loop feeling fresh by implementing a seasonal model akin to args like Path of Exile and Diablo I'll be it a more palatable take on it see when a season ends uh all your gear gets stored in a SE separate inventory that exists across servers you then get to keep playing the same character on the new seasonal server but then you can pull a limited number of items out of this persistent inventory as you play so you could take a couple of your favorite deviations or an electric drill that lets you mine every type of ore so you've now got a head start on your gear you keep all of your crafting recipes your story progression the only things that reset are your character level and Tech Tree but now you've got some new seasonal mechanics to make your journey to max level a little different from the last I didn't get to properly try this out myself since my server doesn't reach its Final Phase until later so I started a fresh character on one of the new seasonal servers to see how it operates and come to find that it offers a drastically different experience it's set in a completely different region of the map a new snowy location with a seasonal mechanic revolving around surviving extreme temperatures I now need to keep a torch lit to stay warm keep a fire going in my home eat hot food I mentioned hard mode servers earlier and safe to say the difficulty tuning here felt much more dialed in to the point that I could really only take on enemies at or below my level matter of fact in This Server there's an additional modifier going on where a Blood Moon Rises at night this causes my Max Health to plummet uh enemies become far more aggressive and they can just randomly Ambush me wherever I go the trade-off is that there's increased rewards uh some exclusive to this event so now there's a real high risk High reward Factor at play here when going out at night and I'm having to do more prep work to Brave the cold I'm interfacing with the game in a radically different way and it's at this point 40 hours into this weird live service looter shooter survival crafting game eager to play more and even up for doing it all over again where I thought to myself wait do I like this game yeah I think I do this live service seasonal model has the potential to keep the game Loop fresh in the years ahead and provide regular entry points to newcomers the looter shooter itemization boasts impressive synergies and enables a compelling endgame chase that other survival games don't and the survival crafting stuff itself is deep but forgiving enough that it doesn't become overbearing it's a genre blend that has every reason not to work at all given the baggage they each carry but I think once human for the most part has pulled it off and for an entry fee of $0 that's at least worth checking out for yourself maybe you're a fan of survival games and are tired of being forced to hop between new releases to get your fix or have to start fresh with a buddy for the seventh time with little variance in your experience maybe you're a Luda shooter fan and you're bored of the usual formula with its mission-based grinds and just after something a little different or maybe somehow you're held on to the false hope that the day before would be the survival game you've always dreamed of and were left disappointed in any case once human might have what you're looking for and for that reason I recommend it to you always
