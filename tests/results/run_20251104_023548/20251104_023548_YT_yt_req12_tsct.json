  "content": "once human mix reviews I know I know we're gonna get into you know what let me just go ahead I'll get into that right now let's get right into it so once human this is the game that came out today I put three to something like that 100 hours into the beta for this game I really like this game it came out today the Stars aligned there was an Intergalactic deal though that was formed out of the causality of the universe that was created explicitly to [ __ ] me in the ass today that I didn't get a chance to play the game because my [ __ ] internet was out all day but now we're back on and I can at least look at some of the reviews I was very excited about the game I'm still very excited about the game but let's read what some people are saying about it okay so once human but never a good game great great super good uh let's see here I'm Lian here for awareness you get the Twitch account to link at Twitch account loading Bay this is I don't give a [ __ ] about this privacy policy overol of personal information and security risks lack of transparency tldr this privacy policy is problematic because it lacks Clarity transparency and appears to over collect personal data um I mean like I really like until I see this energy for Vanguard and uh like you know for valerant and [ __ ] like this and and Riot games I'm not going to take any of people's like privacy complaints seriously I think that people complained about this [ __ ] but they'll play a game any anyway with it right and so yeah I mean you're going to talk about this [ __ ] but not about kental level access to a PC n bro like miss me with that [ __ ] like uh you know like it just doesn't make sense to me other people want to by the way like that's my opinion I don't think that this person is invalid like his opinion is invalid but um collectively like you just can't get me to care about this that much I just can't I just don't really care that much so uh yeah but if you do it's totally justifi you're you're all right uh read their terms of service require information personal info IP address uh no they no they don't like do you think I'm kidding read it like I I don't know about any of that like I I never had to give them any of that stuff before like what are you talking about yeah what the [ __ ] um anyway let's see the rest of this here crypto Miner and personal information identity theft got to consent about them having access pretty much everything about sh of your Social Security number like this is so this that's not even about the game legit spy wear don't get this uh price tags in a shop is horrendous I don't give a [ __ ] about that let me read the rest of this uh I can clearly see where the dev spent their time the endgame shop in the season pass for the worst performance previous test the game feels more shallow empty and soulless than the previous beta test I don't understand how the game changed from The Amazing cbt2 to the uninspired garbage with the colorful catchable pal play TS obviously in love with your fart what the [ __ ] um the what bro what what what so just [ __ ] down votes well I mean like if people care about the like if people care about a security risk that a game has I think that's Justified but here's my opinion on security Risk games I don't really care that much I think that in a world where you have anti-cheats that have internal level access to your PC I would find it to be ridiculous that I would complain about this but have a riot game on my computer logically it would not make sense that this would be a problem but a riot game that by the way Riot is owned 100% it's not like a a it's like a shareholder 10cent owns Riot 10cent is connected to the Chinese government so until you care about that I won't take anything else seriously sorry to say so that that's that's the way I see it I completely respect other people's personal decisions but I'm not going to act based off of it that that's how I feel let's see the rest of this uh this is more about this read all this price size Shop create a character a Net's game people play these games on their phone uh best weapons you only get by spending money on like a Goa system can you do that can you spend money on the game can can you buy uh guns in the game no so this guy's just lying skin for yeah so he yeah all right so he made it up yeah um only cosm yeah that's what I thought right because I so here's the thing I met two of the devs for once human at the otk games Expo I talk to them and I straight up said bro you got a gacha machine in your [ __ ] game and it's called The gacha Machine are we going to be able to buy skins and hey they said no they said no so there it is I thought you could buy the goge coins I don't think you can they got rid of a lot of the atmosphere I.E no fog whenever you fight the tutorial siren now that's stupid yeah that's stupid for sure you mean guns uh you said skins yeah I care about guns I don't care about you can buy you can buy a skin on the store like oh my God it's a free [ __ ] game who cares you can't delete characters one character per account can't change servers see this this shit's [ __ ] stupid this is so [ __ ] stupid this is this is the dumbest thing why would you do this like I I don't know they fixed it good thank God good yeah absolutely uh this game has more micr transactions than an EA game uh the India with wind license uh baked in protects the game default outside doesn't need Min positions uh to work on nose it protects this is a it's a cons uh security concern uh it was a bug yeah it's a bug okay good they fix the bug that's good but like I said this before right is that anything that is about the game is a valid review if you don't like the loading screens for a game and you give it a negative review based off of that you are totally justified in that negative review 100% now that doesn't mean I have to agree with it or care but you also uh you have every right to do that if it's true then it's Justified right do you ever shut up yeah I do what were you mad you mad for well hold up hold up we going to we going to figure this out yeah what what's this so you crying like a [ __ ] getting mad that I'm talking on my own stream that's crazy imagine spending your own time spending your own life getting mad about some stupid [ __ ] like that shut the what a [ __ ] we banned it get the [ __ ] out of here what is wrong with you bro like what are you doing what are you doing with your life fine God what's this loaded up the game pick a server friends got in one character right read the terms and services closed out on the game no thanks H what the [ __ ] is the rest of this worst game made by Chinese for mobile love you game is still current dog water one buddy picked the wrong server can't delete character shovelware Avid I don't think it's shovelware uh I like what I see yeah bro like I'm going to be real I played the [ __ ] out of this game I like this game a lot damn people don't [ __ ] like this game at all that's crazy that that that's sad I like it yeah I don't give a [ __ ] I'm still going to play it yeah I'm still going to play I had a lot of fun playing the game like I every person in the world can hate it and if I like it then it's a good game to me so who cares yeah I've really enjoyed it a lot I think they have a a lot of great Innovation with it especially like moving around read the positive RS well why would I need to read those I already agree with them so yeah I think that some people definitely they see a game made by an Asian developer and they think to themselves uhoh I know that's what happens like I think that's what's happening a lot and it's becoming very common that's it that I mean I'm not saying that's all it is I'm not saying it's like that's everybody but like I'm saying it's a factor it it it there's a it's a factor bro I've seen it for a bit you only think it's good cuz you haven't played Warframe or anything else in the genre that you I mean you could be right you know know like uh you know it's like it's like I thought Little Caesars was great pizza and there's a part of me that wishes that I never ate dominoes because after I ate dominoes I never wanted to eat Little Caesars again cuz like it was just so much better like I I couldn't even I could never even see that again right I could never now Little Caesars you know got me through some tough times a $5 hot and ready on Tuesday Tuesday dude Tuesday was raid night and they were selling pizzas for $5 I wonder what I did every Tuesday so uh that was so it was what it was all about but now I mean if I'm getting a pizza I go to [ __ ] dominoes that being said I haven't played Warr maybe my opinion is wrong but I enjoyed my time playing the game and whether it was fun or not for you that doesn't take away from the enjoyment that I felt from the game and I I I had fun and it's the same as like maybe I'm building up to play Warframe maybe I'm building up to play Destiny and whenever I do that'll be like the you know the [ __ ] climax of me enjoying these games so I don't really have a problem with it yeah so I'm having fun yeah like imagine so like think about if I had played gench and impact and then I played to Tower of fantasy I'd have [ __ ] hated Tower of fantasy no the game was still trash but I didn't hate it that much you know and so that it's like New World's the best action game while you not played Elden ring yeah well I'm just saying like I've played it and I thought it was fun so there it is review synopsis so far I can't change server very poorly optimized uh this game's a mid five I had more fun creating my character I'm going to do that tomorrow uh what's this here once human but never a good game that's good one let's see here absolutely absolute steaming pile of [ __ ] that that's the that's other thing um most antier friendly feature yeah yeah I feel like a lot of these reviews like the majority of these reviews aren't like there's no pay to win grind for the sake of grinding like no they not really like I feel like these people like they didn't play the game I there is pay to win what is it I can confirm it's pay to win let's find out tomorrow we're going to find out we're going to look into it yeah who said it no no I want to know I agree with the grind for the sck of grinding because it wipes every six weeks that's true but you can play on that private server [ __ ] too I'm going to play it in judge yeah exactly and so they not play half the reviews half the reviews are to yeah it's like whenever I look at a review there are in my opinion two different categories of reviews there are reviews about the game and reviews about uh something related like there's reviews about the game and reviews about gameplay so like I care more about game playay reviews and not reviews about the game so for example I care about uh like what the progression system is like oh it had bad Q times I think that'll probably get fixed uh you know you aren't able to make a new character that already got fixed um the [ __ ] like the security [ __ ] right you care about that good for you I don't really give a [ __ ] so that's up to you so like those things to me are like two different categories and I think the majority of the negative reviews that I'm seeing on Steam here are reviews that are about the quality sorry they're about the game and not the game play that's the way I would see it you see what I'm saying hot free Chinese garbage served as a game there it is the AI is still as hopeless as cb23 thank God it was easy to [ __ ] I beat these guys yep there it is sad to see a game actually worse than it was in close beta 3 speedrun the first Bon game feels sluggish heavy and the engine struggling yeah probably there's a lot of people on it yeah [ __ ] why don't you play the game for the rest of your natural life yeah yeah uh why do you care less about security I feel like you have more to lose than others cuz I don't have anything important on this PC at all uh I I I just have my gaming [ __ ] on the PC and that's it and other than that I don't do any type of business or anything like that on this PC in any capacity cuz it it would be uh unsafe why you think I never had an atrio or a vosch situation I never had a single bad thing pop up on my stream you know why it's because it's not on this computer at all it can't happen that's why I can desktop capture I've done it for years there's no weird [ __ ] yeah like that's the reason so you making defects of your friends no but I could do one of you if you wanted here's the thing this is the way I see it right if there are reviews of the game that are negative I think that they're entitled to that I enjoyed the game a lot I'm gonna play it a lot I had a lot of fun so yeah uh I've tried to um and this is like a weird thing but I've really tried to stop thinking about what other people think about games and just make my own decision on the game based off of that and I think that after I did that I became happier with the way games were and a lot of times like the negativity surrounding a game can make the game feel like it's worse than it is and sometimes the positivity surrounding a game can make the game feel better than what it is I think there's that too like uh you know [ __ ] uh you know toxic positivity but for me if I'm playing a game and I'm having fun nobody's going to take that away from me that's the way I see it so you base the quality of the game on other people's reviews but you became the reviewer of course because I think I got to say it the I got to I got to give it the real take I got to look at it the right way like whenever I try to review a game I try to play it and be as honest and fair as I can be because I don't think that a lot of other people are are fair I don't think that they think about it in the right way I think that they get too attached to certain things and what's toxic positivity thinking that Mythic plus is better because you can deplete Keys that's toxic positivity it's a garbage system and anybody who thinks it's good is a [ __ ] so that's like that's an example right I I'll give you some more if you want but that's a good start tried the game massive stutters yeah yeah that's totally fair that's totally fair I hope it's good by tomorrow I do and uh for everybody that wants to play on my server I will pick the most populated PVE server so whatever that server is I will pick that server L take Mythic plus is awesome great well why not make it more awesome see this is what I'm talking about this is what I'm talking about it's sad it's really sad that they don't even that they don't even think about what they're saying PVE yeah I don't want to play on a PVP server why the [ __ ] I want to deal with that [ __ ] absolutely not no way why you play Trash games it'll be a fun stream man I'll play W pretty soon the season of discoveries coming out uh we can make Mythic plus 10 times better by our moving yeah yeah it's simple right I mean there it is PVP people to gank you yeah I I don't want to like bro I want to I play games to relax like I don't want to like I I play games to relax and turn off my brain and stop thinking I'm not trying to go and play a [ __ ] game and like get stressed out about people like going to attack me and [ __ ] like and and hey if I play Rust I'm I know what I'm getting in for right like that's the way that's rust that's the game it's a great game it's one of the best games ever made but I'm not playing rust all the time I'm just casual like I'm a I'm a casual player like I don't care about this I don't want to I don't want to try to be like good at the game especially whenever I got people that are like triangulating my location oh okay all right I'm hacking in there he is he's on stream okay look at his coordinates okay uh 35 West uh 33 uh North uh all right we're on route to his location all right we have five people with us let's shoot him all right Bill get the clip we're going to shoot him right here we post this on Tik Tok killing asmin ball no I don't want to [ __ ] deal with that why the [ __ ] would I want to deal with that it's annoying [ __ ] it's so annoying why to [ __ ] de with that sh just want to play the game just want to chill out yeah that pissed me off so much yeah it does piss me off it's [ __ ] annoying so yeah uh let's see here decent so far I intend to keep playing I won't recommend it though we'll get the next paragraph what's this here uh don't suggest for me to pay for monthly benefits When you already expect me to pay for a battle pass your wallet I think that I'm going to have an unpopular opinion I think that an optional payment that unlocks additional rewards that is a onetime only recur in thing like a monthly payment that effectively functions like a sub or the crystalline Aura for lost Arc is fine this is a free game that's continuously updated that's maintained that has live servers I think that if you want to have a one tier of that that is just literally you buy this thing and then you can play the game at 100% I'm completely fine with that that's totally okay that's that's that's it like I I I think it's totally fine as somebody who comes from the yeah it's I prefer a sub okay if you prefer a sub then call it a sub because that's what it is like that's what it is dev's making money off your data no other developer does that that's the thing this is the only developer that makes money off of your data that's crazy I disagree 100% well then I mean like I don't know I me I don't I don't know I don't think it's a big deal like I I wish that we could go back to days where there was just you had to pay a sub to play the game like wow but I realize that I talk about this from a place of tremendous privilege I can spend $5 and it doesn't matter to me other people can't do that if you live in Brazil or Salvador $15 means a lot to you so for you you need to have these free-to-play games and I think that it's better that the games are worldwide and they're accessible to a huge audience of people and it's a global it's a global phenomenon I I I love gaming being Global and because of that I think it's okay for games to be free to playay it's fine the problem is that so here's what the problem is with pay to win I've done this before so I apologize if people have seen this before I'm I'm going to try and keep it brief and not waste too much time so pay to win is only a problem when it's like this this is what the problem is right is when a person that spends $15 is weaker than a person who spends $5 who is weaker than a person who spends $150 who is weaker than a person who spends $750 who is weaker than a person who spends $2,000 that is what I think is toxic and bad a small sub fee that is optional inside of a free-to-play game that unlocks the full features of the game for a period of time that is a one-time purchase for a reasonable price effectively functions like a subscription and I think that it's totally fine I think that's a great way of monetization that's what my opinion is that's literally OS yeah that's literally wow if you think this is bad and you play wow you're stupid this is how wow is one time purchase once a month yeah well that's what I mean right it's like yeah you're paying a sub for the game no [ __ ] are you [ __ ] stupid of course because the game's continuously adding new content duh of course",
