Only one actual store takes real currency, and again, it's mostly cosmetics. The battle pass is $9.99 and is only cosmetics and a few consumables and currencies that you can get in the game anyway.

The survival aspect is good, the storyline is linear, but there's no need to follow it if you don't want to. The building and customization are great. Thge atmosphere changes in a very natural way so you get a bit of everything. Wanna go out on a cleaning spree? You can. Wanna get underground, explore deep storylines and fight bosses? You can. Wanna get a nice view of the land while fishing in a lake with the sun on your face? YOU CAN. Once Human speaks to many players in different ways, and that's exceptional in it's own. You can spend money on cosmetics and ''looking cool'', but for the real experience you HAVE to grind. Once Human is a great survival game for both beginners in the genre and experienced players, and with it still being in Early Access, this game has huge potential.",

Sure there are microtransactions, and season pass and all the GaaS crap, but without any of that, you can still get actually pretty good loot, and I personally don't feel the game to be too grindy, for example, every resource node gives you a pretty decent amount of resources, and even more with upgraded tools (unlike Subsistence where you need to chop 1M trees for a foundation and two walls). Is not flawless in anyway, it can be a bit janky, buggy and what not, but I have not had any single game breaking experience (aside from a few T-Posing or sliding character, which some times happens in online games, so is not that bad). I do agree with jake, in that there is a lot of lore and background story and what not, but I am not that into that, so personally i am not affected by that. I love that I can play PvE, which means I don't have to worry about random players ruining the experience for me. The game does have a ton of content, and that is both good and bad, good because there is a toon of stuff and exploration bad because it can be a bit overwhelming.",

The game also is heavily geared towards clans/warbands and rewards collaborative planning of specialties and base building. Also, as noted, the seasonal transition mechanism is probably the best in any arpg with the ability to bring stuff with you (I would only bring the rarest deviants and would instead carry over more practical gear like chainsaws and drills).

The list below is everything you'll keep, regardless of seasons and servers switching up: Important Currency: Starchroms, Crystgins, Mitsuko's Marks, Stellar Planula, and Sproutlets Gear Blueprints (and their stars), Blueprint Fragments, Weapon Accessories, and Mods Furniture Formulas (except those gained through your Memetics) Cosmetics, Expressions and Poses, Namecards, and more House Blueprints. After a House Blueprint is saved, you can reconstruct the building at any time (if advanced materials are not available, basic materials will be used in building instead) Main story and side story task progress (for the tasks you've already completed, you can accept more streamlined versions of them in the new season but still get all the rewards) Your friend list will fully carry over. Furthermore, you can check which players joined your Warband in the previous seasons and add them to your friend list The list below is content that is \"partially carried over\" into a new Once Human season: Essential resources like materials, medicine, and ammunition can be carried over into a new season based on item transferring rules so you can progress faster in the new season And besides all that, you have your Eternaland where nothing get's ever reset and you can most of your stuff in there and partly even out again for the next season.

The gunplay is good, the guns feel varied and properly punchy, the feedback is great, as is the sound design. What really surprised me is how good melee felt in this gun-focused game; it is floaty, but it feels really good to me. I particularly like the shoulder charge move.

As this is a sponsored video, Force cannot give the list of cons that he normally does so I'll give you a quick list here. - Keyword effects are still broken. They work around 30% of the time so you lose 90% of your damage in open world events. - The scenario is hard difficulty, so even the first enemies you come across are insanely strong. - Levels for areas have been changed too so farming specific resources requires going to different areas than you would have in previous scenarios. - There are no Prime Wars or Thermal Towers. - They added scaling for the Nightmare Tubes, the more players, the more ridiculous the HP of the boss. - Dream Zones need to be cleared before you can build a base in the location and the Dream Zone respawn after X amount of time. - You cannot enter Silos or Monoliths if a Dream Zone is active on them. You need to clear the Dreamer every single time they respawn in order to run them. Super dumb. - You cannot teleport to a location that is inside a Dream Zone, so if you put a camp down and a Dream Zone spawns on it, you can't teleport to it anymore. I think they are changing that on July 2nd though. - They added permanent servers. To get to them, select a Scenario and wait until the scenario ends, at which point you get moved to the permanent version automatically. However, permanent servers do not get new content (apart from Visional Wheel stuff but those are events, not real content). - The priorities of the devs is STILL very much gacha loot crates. The newest loot crate even has an entire building set in it so it's not just character cosmetics anymore and it would cost around $300-400 to get that building set from the gacha. Ultimately, in case my time played wasn't enough of an indicator, I think Once Human might be the best MMO on the market at the moment AND it's free. However, it has a ridiculous amount of issues that devs are just not interested in fixing because loot crates are making them so much money.",
