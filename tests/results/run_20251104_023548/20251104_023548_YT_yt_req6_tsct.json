  "content": "Once Human is a free-to-play openw world multiplayer survival looter shooter with a supernatural twist. It blends traditional survival mechanics like crafting, base building, resource gathering, keeping track of your hunger and thirst bars with added gunplay, exploration, and a shared open world with both PvE and PvP content. As a review, the game has been fully released to the public for over a year, and the player numbers remain fairly strong, which means it's definitely doing something right. Now, what about the actual gameplay? At its core, one human follows the familiar survival game loop. You wake up in a hostile world, scavenge for gear, craft weapons, build a base, and push further into dangerous zones. Each town, city, or random military base has an Assassin's Creed like completion mechanic where you need to kill a certain number of enemies, find the hidden gear or weapon chests, activate a rift anchor, and finally find the special mythic chest for the best loot. This serves as a good way to gear up fast and earn experience for the harder zones later on in the game. Thankfully, other players are rather friendly and can leave Dark Souls like messages to help new players find their loot faster. Combat is a mix of varied ranged weapons with some melee in the mix for the rare close encounter. Thankfully, the game offers a large variety of weapons and gear, custom upgrades, and different mods to keep things fresh. Safe to say each player is bound to find what works best for their play style. Enemies range from the usual zombie-like people to mutated wildlife and all the way up to other worldly horrors. This abundant variety helps keep the early game grind from feeling too repetitive. There are also massive boss battles for each new region of the game. The boss fights are all unique with their own custom mechanics, attack styles, and even a dedicated area to fight them. Where the game did surprise me is letting the player fight a weaker version of the boss, sort of like a shadow, way before actually jumping into the actual fight. These fights can be done solo or in a party, and have varied difficulty levels to offer a challenge at any point in the game. The world itself is large and diverse. You'll explore forests, swamps, ruined castles, flooded towns, and corrupted zones. The map is dotted with points of interest, such as abandoned labs, enemy strongholds, world bosses, and loadable chests. The entire world map has absolutely zero loading screens, apart from the few instant zones for challenges, and boss fights. There's also plenty of environmental storytelling throughout the world, and the Stardust Corruption adds a weird sci-fi etched the otherwise familiar setting. Traversal is solid with craftable vehicles stemming from just a simple dirt bike. all the way up to a fourperson Humvey. You'll also encounter climbing mechanics, an unlockable fast travel system, and co-op play, all to help avoid the usual openw world fatigue. Lastly, there are various critters for you to find and collect, similar to what you'd see in PAL World. They can help you in combat or gather up resources to save you time later on in the game. Once human can be played solo, but is clearly built for co-op or light animal style play. You'll run into other players in the world, join factions, trade, or fight in PvP. base building is surprisingly deep. You can design custom layouts, set up defenses, assign crafting stations, expand personal territory, install electrical systems to power turrets, and quite a bit more. Some systems still feel a bit clunky, like placement and storage in particular, but it's flexible enough to make your space feel like your own. You also have the ability to specialize in a certain field, for example, gunsmithing or dedicating yourself to farming and cooking. Each field has its own bonuses that complements those of your party. Visually, one human is a mixed bag. Some areas are generally striking with eerie lighting, dense fog, flooded houses, and grotesque yet unique creature designs. Others feel a bit flat and rough around the edges. The sound design does a good job at reinforcing tension. Gunfire sounds sharp. Enemies have distinct audio cues, and the ambient soundtrack fits the post-apocalyptic tone rather well. Performance is generally stable, though lower-end machines may struggle in densely populated zones or during events. That being said, the game is able to notice if your machine is struggling to keep up and even suggest automatically updating your settings to bring the performance back up to par. One of the more unique aspects of Once Human is a seasonal servers, which introduce world modifiers that drastically alter how you play. Some servers throw you into harsh winter conditions where you'll need heat sources and thermal gear to survive. Others mess around with core physics like reduce gravity, which affects movement and combat in unexpected ways. These servers not only keep the gameplay fresh, but also push you to rethink your usual survival strategies. This also helps new players experience additional content while giving older players a new perspective and a new mode to play around with. So, the question is, do I recommend the game? Well, yeah, I actually do. It's certainly not perfect, and by blending survival game mechanics with looter shooters, it has all the room for it to just not work. But in the end, it actually does. It's still evolving. Some systems could use some polish and the frequent server wipes can get rather old for players just wanting to take a break. But if you enjoy games like Rust, Wallheim, Borderlands, or even Warframe and want something with a sci-fi love, crafty and twist is worth a look. And with that being said, thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next 4-minute Once Human is a free-to-play openw world multiplayer survival looter shooter with a supernatural twist.
