  "content": "some of your favorite games have been packaged into one cohesive Survival action game that is right now only available on PC and it's free to play and it's called once human with an addictive Loop of gathering materials crafting and building up your character and upgrading gear and venturing out into the world it is nothing like you've ever seen before once human is a free to play Survival game and fans of loot-based survival games with crafting survival titles like power world with the Mystique of death stranding and control wrapped into a package that feels like stay Decay and days gone with a creepy twist once human is created by star Studios a Chinese developer with a penchant for stylized visuals and stylized characters the world you literally drop into is a post-apocalyptic imagining of Earth long after it has been decimated by other dimensional creatures and deviations which are amalgamations of zombie like creatures and beasts that have mixed with ordinary everyday parts of our world you play as a mayfly a superpowered character that is meant to help repair this broken World once human is much like the fame 2024 hit power world as you drop in with a custom character you build your own base it is very familiar to fans that like games like grounded valheim rust games that allow you to build a custom home base get refineries and machines that you'll use to build Gathering and discovering materials so you can create better weapons and armor for your character the game is played in third person with a full open world that you can travel to on a motorcycle melee and third person shooting is very familiar and feels very satisfying to slice up soldiers and zombies with a machete or aim down the sight are over the shoulder with familiar weapons like SMGs AKs shotguns and even crossbows in this world you'll encounter fog-like infected areas with demonic evolved creatures so at times it can feel like a zombie open world and then you get this Twist of an open world game like remedy control you'll be able to telekinetically pick up some items and hurl them at enemies and using your own Dimension Vision to look for rare loot and items all of this can be brought back to your base to get better upgrades the open world is immediately satisfying with Landmark unlocks for teleporting around the world finding enemy outposts and working your way into massive dungeons that have you take on a huge boss battle and these are all set according to level and as you play through the game and explore the world you'll gain the ability to find items that will help you build your character to become even more powerful and give you access to better gear and better weapons the narrative in once's human is kind of strange and follows many tropes we see across Eastern RPGs some of the characters are pretty eccentric others don't speak at all as voice dialogue of the main characters haven't even been added to the game yet once human has only just released in its Early Access free to play mode since July 2024 it's still early on in its public availability just on PC but developers have said they plan to bring it to Xbox and PlayStation consoles as soon as they get more of the development fleshed out what's here is a very satisfying gameplay Loop combat feels great taking down enemies feels Punchy and Gathering all the scraps and loot and bringing them down to your home base gives you a sense of ownership as you gather in a mass of large quantity of items in the world that allow you to craft structures and unlock more abilities once human has a system called mics where you can unlock the ability to create upgrades for your base or have the ability to craft and refine materials into defenses and survival Necessities fans of stay Decay will see many similarities in the world loot system and combat except with Once human you given what seems to be aund times more inventory space on your character and especially stuff you can hold in your base and the actual building you can do being out in the open world you do not feel restricted to pick up everything you want and bring it home and disassembling scrap into crafting components also lends to a feeling of progress and satisfaction when you go out on big loot missions and take out settlements enemies will frequently respawn not long after walking away so you don't feel like you're cleaning the world but there's always something to look for and there's always enemies to take down to help you level up your character now one of the major concerns for players is that every 6 weeks they introduce a new season and a new map to Once human and your character progression is slightly reset star Studios producer said we are here to reassure you that this will not happen we value the time and effort you put into this game so the items and gear you have obtained from the seasonal scenario will be retained in various ways your character is reverted to level one at the start of a new season and they'll start on a fresh unrevealed map but players will be able to carry a good deal of progress between seasons including blueprints Furniture formulas cosmetics and custom house blueprints completed story tasks will be remembered and players will be able to redo streamlined versions of them to get their Associated rewards resources like ammunition and medicine will also partially be carried over and quote once human is still in full development but available as a free-to-play business model right now where there are microtransactions for Cosmetics which are pretty wildl looking but you can still unlock some gear in cosmetics Naturally by just playing the game so the world is always being improved upon with the updates and seasonal changes bringing a new map could reinvigorate excitement as I've already poured over 30 hours in this first week of playing once human and I've done all of this so far just solo and you will find other players out in the world who are there just to cooperatively but there is a PVP mode if you want to play this on Console but don't want to wait the game is pretty decently optimized for most PCS and even ran great on the rag Ally or steam deck oh and you'll encounter bugs or glitches or have to restart after a checkpoint if something doesn't work but so far I've had a ton of fun I've been pretty invested with my time in once human what's here for a free-to-play model is definitely worth your time if you enjoy games like State of Decay days gone control death stranding or even power world and yes you'll be able to capture some Pals or Pokemon like creatures in the world and bring them into your base and they have all different types of abilities that you can use once human is definitely a strange game and with its conventional combat controls and the feel of the guns and weapons that you'd expect in an open world third person game you can get lost in this weird deviated post-apocalyptic Earth I feel like once human has a lot to offer for gamers and I hope it's coming to console sooner than later but if you've got a semic capable PC I would definitely recommend checking it out help during my downtime for games I was looking around for what was I going to play next as we waited for games that have been pushed out and delayed and then I went to steam and checked around and it was highly recommended one hum so I just downloaded and started playing I was immediately hooked and wanted to make a video and show most people who probably on Console don't know much about once human so I wanted to Showcase it and really try and give you an idea of what this game would be if you played on console and power world was a big hit at the beginning of the year and it's a game I played some 40 to 50 hours in and the survival elements and building and crafting has kind of become a new favorite of mine so once human kind of resonated with me especially since it feels like some of those other third person open world action Venture games that I really like so if you ended up enjoying this video let me know by liking and subscribing to the channel if you
