  "content": "You see the map screen? You jumping in? Yeah. I'm floating down a little eagle guy. I got a bird and hold on to his talents. Hope he don't do anything. But I'm a beast master. I let go of a bird. John, what do I do now? I don't know. [ __ ] Welcome back to Once Human. If you remember, I played this game a little while back and it went something like this. You look like something that pops up in a haunted house. Get a photo. Oh my god. Yummy. Hold on. Don't throw it up. I'm doing it. Got it. Perfect. Yeah, I'm going to come throw up on all your stuff. That's great. Under the water. That's right. After that absolute disaster of a time we had, they wanted us to come back and play their biggest update of 2025. So, before this video goes any further, yes, this video is sponsored by Once Human. In this new update for the game, the new content is called Dream Veil. It's basically as if you went to sleep in the game and then woke up to whatever the hell this is. Guys, there's a little spider with a propane tank on it. There's a lot happening right now. Yeah, they blew up. Hell yeah. New monsters, challenges, and entities that look like they just crawled straight out of the back rooms. This version of the game is miles different from what we played a while back. Your goal in Dreamville is essentially to cleanse the nightmares of your dreams. The dream state map is absolutely littered with new challenges and new monsters to fight. They even made a point of giving us boosted press accounts so we could explore further into the game, and that went fantastic. But like the last time we played this game, we wanted to start fresh because honestly, the character creator in this game is one of the best I've ever seen. Like, what in God's name is this? Why would you allow me to create this thing? So, again, big shout out to Once Human for sponsoring this video in the first place. I really appreciate it. Once Human is available on PC and mobile, so make sure you head down to the link in the description and download the game today. And it will also be coming to console soon, so make sure you wishlist it where you can. Leave a like on the video if you enjoy. Subscribe to the channel if you're new. And thank you so much for watching in the first place. I hope you enjoy the rest of the video. Go to type two. Check out the [ __ ] absolute front porch on the type two.

I got him. My bike away. There's like a shadow guy. He's like creeping around here. Look at him. He seems all right. He hasn't attacked me yet. He's screaming. He's attacking me. Also, I can't I can't do any damage to him, seeing as Yeah, he's not a cow. We got to take out a source of his power, the TVs. I am currently farming a rock for gravel. Oh, we need band of clarity. Oh, yeah. Let's get that. Now, this is the point in the video where we actually realize, hold on, maybe we're struggling a little bit too much to show the content they actually want us to show you. So, this is the point we decided to log on to the press accounts. And oh boy, did that go just as great. Does he have an RPG? Oh my god. But besides that, we actually got access to a bunch of resources we wouldn't normally have if we were just starting out. So, that was a blast. These accounts were absolutely dripped out with a bunch of stuff. So, naturally, we just decided to mess up the character's appearance on these press accounts. Like, look at this. Here's a before and after. What the hell happened? I loaded in and I just looked up at the sky and I'm like, \"Wow, it sure is beautiful today.\" Good. Wait, are both of you big booty [ __ ] What did I get? Oh, hell no. I can't show this, guys. Guys, guys, I'm built like a gamer sub's waifu cup. Yeah, you really are. Editor, keep it blurred, but show one frame of it. All right, good luck, viewers. John, lead us to the promise lane. You know, that was really epic for a second. Then I thought I was going to land that [ __ ] I lie. Man, don't drive into that. Oh my god, he jumped it. Dude, my bike. Ble. Dude, dude, my bike. Am I Guys, keep following me trying. I got stuck on his bike, dude. Just get off the bike. You can just Dude, I can't get off my bike. I'm trying. All right, I'm good. Wow, John, well done. You built a good base. I'm going to do a flip into it. You missed it, Smitty. You read my mind, dude. They're going to get on their [ __ ] press accounts to give to some other YouTuber and be so pissed off. I got to fit, bro. Look how fat my titties are. Yeah, dude. You got some absolute milk trucks. Nobody make fun of me. All right. Looking good. We got the same legs. Hold on. My genetic twin freak feet out. All right. Good build. Good build. I don't know about Let's see the face. Let's see the big it, dude. Dude, I could I could legit suck on your nose. How did you even create that? These two [ __ ] buy you a drink across the bar. You going to sit with them? I am checking what's in my drink. I'm toss I am tossing that [ __ ] over the shoulder. That is awful. Whenever I jump, I got a little aura ring around me. Yeah, you got aura. All right. Okay. How do I So, Dude, dude, dude, I look like Little Red Riding Hood with the evil witch. No. Come, come sit in grandma's bed. I'm real glad we decided to ruin these press accounts because you know, I think you and I use the word ruin a little bit differently. Let's fight the ravenous hunter. Thor falls miji. If you can keep up here. Oh my god. When I jump on my bike, this is the greatest thing ever. Wait. Oh, I'm going to hit this jump. I missed it. Oh god. Trees, trees, trees, trees. I'm kind of going super quick right now. Yeah, I know. You hold up. Yeah, you do that. You're going real quick, guys. Stop. Stop. Stop. Jesus. Look at that. Mad Max jump in the back. Oh no, that didn't hurt. Jesus Christ. We're becoming one. How about you? Wait, I'm in a dream zone right now. Holy crap. That's like the whole point of this. No way. Oh my god, John. Do you see that big thing with the big legs and the big the chakus weevil? Yeah. Sorry. What the weevil? He's throwing [ __ ] around. Run into Oh, I didn't check. Guys, this little spider with a propane tank on it. There's a lot happening right now. Blow up. Yeah, they blow up. Hell yeah. You don't mind if I blow up the chackle wevil? Yeah, bro. Shoot the shack weevil. Hey, chilo weevil. [ __ ] off. Is it dead? Yeah, the chakus weevil has died. What the [ __ ] are that thing? What the hell? I'm right here. Are those bombs? I'm dead. I'm okay. I'm shooting his butthole. Yay. Quick. It sounded like he kind of liked it. Wait, do you think there's damage if you land? Uhoh. Oh, we're good. No, he's a funny move. He hit me. It did happen. It just took a little while. Oh, so wait. Fear is attacking John like directly. Fear from the fear. I love the fear running away. Hey, the thing's here. Hey, low is lowest 100. Does he have an RPG? Oh my god. Oh my god. So, he has an RPG, huh? Okay, so let's take that into consideration. Oh my god, I died again. Can you res me? Uh, yeah. So, as it turns out, even with a press account, we still have no idea what we're doing. So, we decided to scale back and try and figure out what was going on. We built some bases and we're given access to infinite amounts of supplies to which we tried to better our weapons so we potentially had a better chance. Okay, good news. Placing a base gave me everything I need to make a rocket launcher. So, you know, this this will go well. I'm going to put my bed right next to Matt so I can look at him while I sleep. Don't don't don't don't like that. Take a photo of me. Dude, I look like so beautiful on here. You block. Okay. Well, if John was talking to me like that, I'd be about it. You You're [ __ ] weird. Over here, hold on. I'm [ __ ] insane. I got to rest. Let me take a nap. I'll be up in a moment. I'm resting. Okay. So, some guy just Yeah, he you have to give me a kiss and I'll wake up. Wait. Oh, perfect. Dude, he's mounting me. He's on top of me. Oh my god. Please, dude. How is my insanity going down? My real life insanity is going up as this one goes down. I look like Woody from Toy Story if he was [ __ ] It's funny. Yeah, I believe on [ __ ] God. There's a snake in my boot. Hey, don't shoot at me. I'm just watching. I'm just a spectator. It wasn't even me. Wasn't even me. It wasn't even little old me. Go back to work, man. Just relax. All right. All right. Editor, I spy a weird little firing RPG's ass. Wasn't me. Yeah. So, what? So, I see. Yeah. So, I can see you kicking the little rocks up there. Nope. I'm just doing push-ups. Do push-ups. Let me go ahead and look back behind me. Hey, look at my nutcracker.
