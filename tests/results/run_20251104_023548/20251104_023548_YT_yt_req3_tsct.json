  "content": "all right let's review Once human shall we uh the game officially launched this week I have played an ungodly amount over the past 4 days coupled with my time during the beta and I'm a little over 150 hours at this point which pretty much speaks for itself I wouldn't have sunk anywhere remotely close to that amount of time had I not been enjoying a lot of what I was playing though I do have plenty of critiques for parts of the game and there's definitely room for improvement overall though I like one's human I like it about 150 hours worth man boy I have been gaming recently let me tell you uh it's a combination of multiple things from some of my favorite genres into a single package and put into the shared open world with other people and yeah I've just been having a good time flat out funny enough this is like the inverse situation to the recently released first ascendant where with that game I got why people liked it but it just wasn't clicking for me here with Once human I totally understand why people won't like this one but I am having a lot of fun subjectivity strikes once again yeah all right so if you happen to miss my prior coverage or if this is the first time you're hearing about the game I want to start with a basic overview after which we'll go over my Impressions what I like what I dislike give some feedback I'm also going be covering some of the issues that cropped up around launch the dreaded privacy policy and Seasons question mark what's that all about uh okay let's get into it starting with the basics so once human at its core is a shared open world looter shooter MMO light Survival game with a supernatural twist it's quite a mouthful but the game is very much a blending of different things in fact that's a large part of what I've enjoyed structurally the open world reminds me of the division or Defiance you've got one seamless open space you can freely explore with no loading screens aside from when you fast travel or enter instance dungeons other than that it is a fully open Play space with tons of stuff to do and other people running around so after the initial tutorial the main story Quest takes you along The Narrative of course but also introduces you to the game's many different systems and features this starts with a basics of survival because this game is also a survival game you'll gather some wood and stone build a camp craft yourself some basic weapon consumables and some ammo before sending you off to engage with the many activities and things there are to do in the open world and this is where the game really starts feeling a lot more like that mmoe looter shooter right so strongholds this is one big standout every single zone will have anywhere from like four to six of these typically there are quite large locations with a very specific setting and theme so for example you've got hospitals coastal towns factories research facilities Farms military compounds Mountain Villages the list goes on and on these areas are not only big named and Visually distinct but they also come with their own set of objectives these can vary somewhat but typically when you enter any stronghold it's going to ask you to kill a certain number of enemies loot armor weapon and mystical chest in the area and activate the rift anchor which itself will give you valuable rewards but also helps you progress to the next major boss fight which brings us to the monolith bosses these are Pinnacle encounters that you work towards by progressing the main story Quest and clearing most of the strongholds in every Zone technically you don't actually need to clear the strongholds you just need to click the rift anchors but they're located in the strongholds and you want to clear those anyways because they get valuable rewards as well as experience but yes you progress the story you reach a point where it asks you to get these Rift anchors at the strongholds once that's complete you've unlocked that area's monolith fight these are big bosses what I would call almost raid like encounters with various mechanics and different phases it's some of the more difficult content in the game currently although this might change in the well will change in the future as the season progresses and we get things like hard modes and new content types but there are these monolith bosses these are like the big challenge as of now uh currently there are three of them that we can fight the first one is the foul Shadow Hunter this like Twisted mutant with a massive gun mounted to one arm he summons ads shoots rockets and spews out pools of poison then there is the Triant this huge almost dinosaur-like creature with that's like combined with a tree and has a girl on its head riding its back or something this one summons giant tentacle branches HS out bubbles and shoots a laser beam and then there is arxium a massive spider lady with big sweeping attacks she shoots webs sprays mist and summons hordes of mini spiders now there are at least two additional monolith bosses that we know of from playing the betas and these will be unlocked in the coming phases as season 1 progresses and hopefully we'll get even more of these monolith boss fights because it is some of the harder challenge but also some of the more interesting PVE content in the game but there's also silos which are basically this game's version of dungeons you'll find their entrance out in the open world there's usually side quest pointing you in the direction once you arrive you can load into an instant version of The Silo with multiple difficulty tiers to choose from there is solo and later you unlock group and hard modes the dungeons themselves the silos are pretty straightforward you move through corridors and rooms looting eliminating basic enemies taking on Elites and then fighting some sort of a boss at the end those bosses not not as substantial as the monolith boss encounters but they can still put up a bit of a fight silos are farmable content there's even an option to instantly re-enter once you finish and they give nice rewards for account and gear progression also most of the silos will have these optional secret boss encounters that you can find by straying off of the main path at a certain point so you've got the strong holds the big bases almost Ubisoft style areas to clear you've got the monolith Pinnacle boss battles you've got the silos which are like Dungeons beyond that there are quite a few other types of point of interest in the open world every single region will have one major town the these towns will have a similar assortment of NPC Quest givers and vendors for you to interact with there's also a ton of smaller enemy camps they're like condensed versions of the strongholds dotted all around the map they usually consist of at least a couple of buildings a few different areas they aren't as large and also don't have the associated Quest but these areas are still worth exploring they've got good loot and they can also many times have Elite enemies which are always worth killing for their rewards and then there's teleportation Towers in the game scattered all about you actually have to go up to and physically on lock these before you can use them but yes it does have fast travel as an option outside of those major points of interest content types there's a metric ton of world events there's just so much variety of things to see and do this has actually played a very large role in what I've enjoyed about the game so it's a mixture of static and dynamic content that you're going to find all over the place here's a rundown of just some of it you'll see fog events these areas where fog Will Roll in out of nowhere entering it starts this timer that begins a challenge usually to kill some mini boss or waves of enemies jumping puzzles you're going to see these purple glowing shards randomly out in the world walking over to it begins an event spawning another Shard somewhere nearby finding and collecting all the shards will spawn a loot chest there are roaming bosses like the spider bus that Stomps through the streets houses that lift up and walk around or space whales there's also large World bosses at certain of the strongholds like the giant flower head boss that's found in the stadium at Overlook town there are also public group events these will appear every so often throughout the day there's things like the Disco event where you have to shoot floating disco balls with a group of players they're dig to hell this mind that you have to defend NPC miners against hordes of enemies swarming in there's the swamp event where you have to defeat these big swamp monsters and that's just to name a few there are quite a lot of different public group events also all of these particular kinds of events will have these heroic legendary modes that can be activated if you meet certain conditions while participating in it there's also PVP events if you're into the PVP thing we've seen things like cargo Shuffle this truck drives around the map blaring music every once in a while it stops and Jellyfish pop out attaching themselves to the heads of players and triggering open world PVP for all who are participating there's also that space whale that I mentioned this you'll just see this whale flying above the map and it drops these orbs periodically if you pick up one of the orbs you're actually flagged for PVP you can't fast travel the goal at this point is to get the orb back to your base and put it in the resonator in which it turns into star chrom which is like a primary resource for endgame progression which get to there's also these things called the prime War now this isn't available as of now in the current live version but it will be coming as the season progresses and we've seen it in action due to all of our time sunk in the beta test so these are basically large scale fights against those monolith bosses but there's a Twist instead of being these instance encounters that you do Solo or with a group of players they actually spawn in the open world and they're much more difficult they're going to appear in certain occupied War band territories around the map when this happens you're band which is basically like your guild has to set up defenses to defend your base and break the armor of this super buffed version of the monolith boss fights and those are just some examples of the uh different world and public events on top of that the game has a ton of different like secrets and Mysteries uh this is where a lot of the supernatural elements come into play that remind me so much of games like the secret world or control so you've got things like memory puzzles riddles secret codes treasure hunts of All Sorts you might come across a ghost who gives you Clues to help find something that they lost and then you're going to have to figure out what they're asking for and search the surrounding area you're going to find cameras randomly out in the world interacting with them actually summons a mimic of yourself doing an emote if you copy that emote it completes the event and you get a reward you'll sometimes see traffic cones laying around in a pattern standing inside of those actually will highlight a nearby broken sign something say like a billboard and then if you pull out your camera and line up these two separate pieces you can make the sign appear whole again and get a reward or you might see a bunch of lily pads on a body of water jumping on them lights them up going from one lily pad to another lights them all and completes the event occasionally while running around you'll see a notification that you're near a ripple in space time and then you can proc this by snapping your fingers now this mechanic is used in some of the story progression it's also used to highlight nearby Collectibles and loot chest or in these Ripple and space times if you snap your fingers it will reveal certain hidden side quest and events like a nearby Loot Crate or an in visible mini boss the game just has like so many little interesting nice touches like these that have made exploring and spending time in the world really enjoyable for me it's again it's a large part of what I've enjoyed so you've got all this variety of stuff in addition to the main story and side quest you're clearing the strongholds you're doing The Silo dungeons you're fighting the monolith bosses but on top of that there's a whole another layer of this being a survival crafting game as well so there are numerous survival mechanics you've got a stamina bar for running jumping dodging and harvesting you've also got the sand s ity hydration and hunger meters you'll have to eat and drink to keep up your hunger and hydration meters and having them above a certain threshold as these meters are broken up into quadrants if they're in the highest threshold you get big boost to things like your move speed your health damage and various other Buffs but there's also the sanity system so while you're in certain areas a lot of times it's the supernatural spots like spending time in contamination zones fighting certain enemies but also if you eat bad food or drink polluted water all of these things will deplete your sanity so your max Health actually gets reduced in direct proportion to the amount of Sanity that you've accumulated and if you drop below 50% sanity you are at half Health but also you start getting various random debuffs that can be really really well they're really they're debuffs they're very not helpful so there are certain items that allow you to regain sanity or you can even rest in a bed there's also gear sets in the game with large amounts of sanity depletion resistance but this is just like another survival mechanic to interact with and it's actually rather interesting and plays into the setting of The Game there's also full-on Base building so you start by placing a territory this can be put pretty much anywhere in the world really the only restriction is you can't put one too close to a stronghold or in certain terrain like on roads but otherwise you can build a base pretty much anywhere in fact you will see that when you're playing that there are player bases all over the environment out in the woods off the side of towns just everywhere you go you're going to see player bases now once you place your territory you can then start building a base you've got the basic structural templates you can put down for floors walls ceilings roof stairs windows and doors there are facilities with stations for crafting storage fortifications and power generation and then there's also customization like you can place down furniture and wallpapers for decorating the environments they're they are pretty generous with the building it really doesn't take much time to be able to construct like a sizable base and after you've built a base you can actually freely relocate it whenever so long as the new spot you're putting it doesn't overlap with another player's territory or isn't in one of those restricted areas you can move the whole thing at any point it's just got a 10-minute cool down but that's it you can just move your base around the world as you continue to progress there's also a camping system you can put down this little mini camp anywhere this lets you craft basic food tools and ammo but also primarily it acts as a extra respawn point for if you die so often times when you come up to a stronghold or a boss fight you're going to see a bunch of other player camps lying around as a Insurance in case they die during that content and of course there's Gathering system to go along with all this you'll get resources for Base building as well as crafting you'll have to gather all the usual Fair here there's various types of trees ores Rock herbs flowers fruits vegetables and animals to be gathered harvested and processed in service of building your base and making consumables and crafting your gear which then brings us to progression so the primary form of Gear power progression in this game is done via crafting there are gear drops in the game like you're going to randomly find pieces of uh armor and weapons but they are rare and they're really only used as a stop Gap while you're working on your crafted pieces like you might find a higher Rarity weapon and a different type of weapon than what your current Curr L using or what you can craft and you'll use it for a bit before it breaks eventually through use but it just lets you try something else really once human gear progression getting gear and the gear that you're going for the most important stuff the best sets everything it all revolves around this blueprint system so as you play you'll disc discover both armor and weapons blueprints you'll find these doing the many points of interest like the strongholds and also by completing certain like Main and Side Story Quest now once you get a blueprint you can then take materials that you've gathered and craft the item there's also a sub system of blueprint fragments where after you can make an item you can then take fragments of similar blueprints or of the same blueprint that you got for that item and you can use them to power up your existing blueprints there's like a whole star rating system if I get a blueprint for a gun that I like I'll have the blueprint I can craft the gun but if I find more blueprints of that same gun I can fuel those into it to increase its star rating which is just a across the board it's better you got one I think up to five stars that you can eventually get it up to now Beyond those blueprints that you initially find that are rewarded by going through clearing the zones and doing those quests the other and the major form of endgame the way you're getting blueprints is done via the wish machine this is a device that drops random Blueprints and it works almost exactly like most gacha or loot box systems you spend a currency you push a button and then you see what the machine spits out now this is the primary way of late game Power progression as there's only a set number of blueprints that are rewarded from playing beyond that everything else that you're getting is going to come out of the wish machine and a lot of those higher Rarity unique items and set items are also coming out of the wish machine now the currency that's used is called starrr and the only way of getting that is via playing at least currently you get it by completing certain activities there are various weekly lockouts and reward tracks that reward it and then also there's this thing called the Stardust resonator which is a whole another system it's a base defense basically base defense mini game that rewards you up to a set amount of star chrom every week so beyond building your base to make it look pretty and hold all of your facilities you're also going to want to set up defenses you'll put down barricades lay traps and turrets of all kinds in preparation for doing this base defense mode so how it works is you build a stardust resonator you place it in your base and then once you feel your defenses are good and you're ready you put in these items called cortexes into the resonator they will come in different levels but basically the idea is the higher level the cortex the stronger it is the more starcom you'll get but also the harder the hordes of enemies will be you choose the difficulty you choose the timing you choose when you want this to happen and once you start you got a few minutes to fend off these invading enemies doing so without them attacking and destroying your resonator will grant you starcom for spending on that blueprint RNG machine another big part of progression is the Cradle this is the backpack that you have on you at all times and is tied to a lot of your character and crafting progression so first for the crafting progression is the mimics this is a progression tree to unlock various aspects of Base building and crafting as you play doing activities and leveling up will unlock mtic points you then spend those points in any of five categories depending on what unlocks you want for the crafting progression there's also the Cradle override these provide powerful passive Buffs that enhance your combat capabilities doing things like increasing damage for certain weapon types that you use and then there is the mimetic Mastery system where every five levels you're granted A random assortment of four different abilities or powers or unlocks to choose from you pick one and these vary from letting you make stronger harvesting tools to getting more resources from your crafting stations or unlocking entirely new unique recipes for consumables or items or what have you lots of cool customization to choose from in the system now there's the deviations these are basically pets that you collect while playing and these unlock special powers and Buffs for you and your territory deviations can be found from following through the campaign completing quests fishing doing public events and dungeons sometimes you're also going to just find them floating around in the open world and you have to capture them sort of like Pokémon now whenever you collect a deviant you then have to place it in a glass case inside of your base after that you can inspect the Deviant to learn what makes them happy and learn the specifics of what they do and you'll want to adjust their surroundings accordingly to make sure that they're fully satisfied so that they might ask you to change the temperature by making it hotter or colder they might say they like certain sounds or music or specific type of lighting or they might like a certain kind of Decor or objects to be nearby them if you keep them satisfied and happy taking all of the boxes basically they will be more productive and it will boost their unique effects there are many different typ types of deviations that all help with something like territory management combat gadgets they can gather resources for you they're just helpful little pets that you basically have it's pretty cool there's also a mod system pretty straightforward you attach mods to the corresponding piece of gear and it gives you some bonus like increasing damage your defenses or your move speed in the late game this will really help you refine your build tailoring to certain play style the damage types are giving you offensive or defensive enhancements Etc okay so that is pretty much all of the major stuff there is to do and see and what is in one's human right now let's talk about what I like what I dislike the pros and the cons so for starters as I mentioned generally I really like this game I think it just boils down simply to it having the right combination of things that I've enjoyed from other games but in a new package it is a fresh version of things that I've really liked before it reminds me so much of the division of defiance of secret world of it's really cool it's like it's a little bit open world it's a little bit MMO it's a little bit Survival game it's also a little bit Supernatural Thriller horror psychological otherworldly interdimensional stuff it's a cool combination of things and I've liked it it's just been a downright interesting world to spend time in I also really enjoy the gameplay loop with all of the different variety and content and activities after the tutorial you're dropped into the world and you're probably going to want to follow the main quest line as it unlocks and introduces you to all of the systems but what you do is pretty much up to you like you could just focus right away on Survival crafting running around hunting Wildlife Gathering wood Stone and ore and then start building a BAS base and placing down stations you could spend hour you could spend your whole first day 12 hours straight not even progressing the main story and just like building your base and doing survival crafting stuff like that's what you could do or you could do all the mmoe looter shooter stuff you could walk in any direction and will be guaranteed to stumble into something a point of Interest like a stronghold where you could spend 30 to 60 Minutes there taking out all the enemies collecting all of the loot and resources opening the chest fighting the elites a lot of strongholds will even have side quests that are tied into the area that you will find as you're exploring region or maybe you'll come across any of the numerous event types like the fog rolls in or you see the roaming spider bus sauntering down the road or you find a jumping puzzle or there's a ripple in SpaceTime where you snap your finger and figure out what's there or a ghost gives you a riddle to find their long lost puppy or something there's just like so much stuff everywhere and it's great I love the world I love the setting I love the sheer amount of things to do and the fact that it's entirely open world and that there's other people running around I also really like survival crafting games and that is here too like it's got the mmoe open world Stuff Plus full-on Base building which I've spent about a third of my time playing the game just building bases in the various tests and now here at launch simply put you got all of these different things coming together into a package that I've just thoroughly enjoyed there's also a lot of cool little touches and even hidden mechanics in the game so many of those optional side quester missions require you actually figuring something else unless you just Google it the game doesn't tell you explicitly what to do or where to go things like treasure hunting for weapon attachments where you've got a vague map to try to figure out its location events like that camera emote mimic the game doesn't tell you to copy the emote you just see your character doing something and you're like what was that he stuck his tongue out at me I don't understand but if you do it back you complete the event there's also just tons of riddles you'll have to figure out for yourself because there are no map markers nothing pointing you what where to go and what to do just and also all of this a lot of this is tied into like that interdimensional flare that just adds so much to the game I just dig the environments and then the whole deviant system is really fun engage with like every deviant having its own unique benefits some help you in combat they'll do different things but also can even alter your attacks giving you like special moves essentially some will help with Gathering like a woodchuck who cuts down trees or the Minecraft guy who Harvest ore or a paper doll who will sweep your base and occasionally find hidden treasure under your bed it's just a whole another level and layer of systems it's like having Pokemon in this MMO survival crafting game as well there's also like there's hidden mechanics like there's a character weight system so if you do or eat certain things you will your character will gain weight now this has gameplay effects like slowing you down but making you sturdier but then also your character physically gets larger in size and then you can do things like eat expired food to expel get sick and lose the weight but that's a system the game just never tells you about it's just there another major positive and much to my surprise is that this game launched with no pay to win it is a free-to-play loot game and there's not a single means of purchasing power in the cash shop right now none in fact I would actually say this is probably one of the more fair free-to-play loot games that I've ever ever played like the only things you can spend real money for currently are Cosmetics that are related to your character like different looks for your character's outfit and weapons but there's also a lot of Bas related Cosmetics so specifically tons of different ways to make your base look really unique and different are only available in the cash shop there is a battle pass now the free tier does have like power related currencies and stuff but that is free everyone gets it everything on the pay track is just cosmetic and there is a sub called the metap pass but that also only Rewards it's cosmetic there's just nothing tied to power or progression that you can spend money to get nothing at all now the game does have two big Power Gates and that comes in the form of the star chrom and the controllers as I mentioned star chrom is the currency that you use for getting blueprints out of the wish machine and this is going to be one of your main power Gates is getting those rare blueprints to first of all have the armor or weapon but then also to enhance the ones that you have and the controllers are consumables that you get a limited amount of while playing and they basically like keys that you use at the end of dungeons or monolith fights to get extra better rewards from completing that dungeon or that boss fight if they ever let you pay for those if they ever let you spend money to get starcom or controllers that will most certainly be in the realm of pay to win or pay to skip there's also a lot of time gating that's in the game that they could potentially sell bypasses for in the future but as of now they're not you can't buy Star chrom you can't buy controllers and you can't spend money to skip any of the gates I've been playing and grinding this game non stop since it came out and at no point have I ever felt the need to spend money on anything because there's nothing tied to my progression that's available for purchase it's all just visual customization and I don't really care all right so those are all the pros there's a lot generally overall I like this game but there are some cons in fact these are pretty big for a lot of people some of the stuff I'm going to mention here will keep people from enjoying or even wanting to try the game out in the first place I'm also going to include some suggestions and feedback for these as well to see if they can improve it all right number one con the difficulty it's not there this game is incredibly easy across the board like roll your face across the keyboard levels of easy outside of a very few specific forms of content like the monolith bosses if you're at or below level or the base defense if you're solo outside of that most every other combat encounter is a total Breeze like the hardest thing about this game at times is if you let your sanity drop too low and it scales down your max Health one for one so if you got 50% sanity you only have half your health and you might find yourself in a situation where all of a sudden and you die in one to do hits but really for the most part combat is not a challenge in this game don't come here if you're looking for difficult combat encounters that's not that's not what you get I spent most of the past few days like Min maxing my gear as we wait for the start of phase 2 it was super unnecessary everything was dying super easily now it's even more of a joke in fact once Phase 2 starts I'm going to be able to immediately start crafting the next tier of gear which will quickly bypass all of my fine tune gear that I've spent hours calibrating thus far there are harder modes of content that are coming there're literally like hard hard and challenge modes that are being added to the game as well as those open world versions of the monolith bosses but even the hardest stuff in the game isn't very hard for very long at least that was the case in the multiple beta tests that we played maybe that's changed for now my suggestion add more challenging open world concept maybe even just a hard mode to the open world some trigger that you can flip that makes the open world less face roll or and more hard endgame content because again as I mentioned it doesn't stay hard for very long at least based on what we saw in the beta test we'll see if it's any different here as the phases progress uh through launch the number two con here is the game can feel quite floaty I would say the movement and melee in particular I think the shooting feels fine especially actually first person shooting I talk to first person a lot because in first person you just have to line up your your target right with where your guns pointed whereas if you're playing in third person you have to deal with the spread effect of your shots first person shooting actually feels fine but the movement of your character as you navigate the environment as you climb up onto things and the especially the melee it's just super floaty like I don't know if it's latency compensation it probably is to be honest but it can feel very rough at times your character just finds itself kind of drifting around a lot the melee has never felt good and that really hasn't gotten any better here for launch a suggestion here make it less floaty I don't I I don't know what you're can do maybe something uh the third big thing and this is going to be a huge sticking point for a lot of people is that this game runs on Seasons it's a seasonal structure every season lasts only 6 weeks it's like the shortest time span of any seasonal game I've ever played and I know for sure and I've seen this a lot of people hate it especially anyone who wants longer term progression you're going to be grinding and playing for hours unlocking all the stuff it's going to reset every six weeks well not exactly you do carry a lot of things over like your base can be saved as a blueprint that you can place down when when a new season starts and all of the blueprints for the weapons and armor that you've got those will stay with you but when a new season starts you do reset from scratch you start at level one and you have to recollect the materials and repr progress through the season to put everything back together so you have your Bas you have your blueprints but you're going to have to get everything to put it back together if you play a second season now every season is supposed to be adding its own unique twist with new types of content new bosses and even new areas but as of now we really don't know if that's going to feel worth the reset in progression and you having to Reg grind every 6 weeks frankly I expect that I'm going to be done with a game after my first playthrough but for people who are wanting to play for months I totally understand why some people aren't going to like the seasonal thing and that goes along with this seasons is how they Dole it out it's just fairly limited to start like I was basically done with the first phase of the season the first week after around 20 hours and I spent most of my time since then building and Min maxing my gear which as I said wasn't really necessary there's just nothing to do I reached the end of the story content and the end of the zones that I could explore after 20 hours now that said I'm a gamer and that's my job so most people working full-time having a family whatever it is that's taking up your time right going to school about 20 hours in a week to clear all the content that's probably fitting nicely in line with the rest of the things that they're doing in their life but if you are a no life gamer if you're someone like me 20 hours that guy that work through that in like a day bro come on no but seriously the six we resets the server resets I think are going to turn people off as I said though I'll probably I'm just here to enjoy my experience right I don't need things to last in perpetuity in these games I'm going to play I will have the experience that I have I will enjoy it like I've been enjoying it if it resets in 6 weeks I probably won't be coming back to the game anyways or maybe I will maybe one of maybe I'll play one or two seasons but I suspect that'll be the most of it but if you're looking for one long-term game and you don't like the idea of progress being reset even if you do carry some things over every 6 weeks that's going to be a major turnoff for a lot of people totally get that right another M thing that I don't really love about the game is the fact that a lot of the gear and power progression is all tied to the random dice roll of that Loop box machine the wish machine I don't love it I wish they just like let you farm bosses and things to make stuff I wish it all wasn't tied behind this Loop boxy gasta system even though they're they don't let you pay real money for it I'd rather just Farm bosses for loot than farm for a currency that's capped per week and get a certain number of spins from a a a box machine every week I just don't love the presentation of that it is unique I guess and I guess Randomness is Randomness Randomness from a boss is no not like how much different is Randomness from killing a boss from Randomness from spinning a machine but you had to kill a boss to let you spin the machine right I get it but it's just I don't I I prefer to just kill the boss and get my whatever 5% chance to get a piece of gear then do the whole machine thing right especially since the the potential for them selling starcom in the future does exist as long as they have starom tied to a Gamba machine that is where you get most of your power they're just one step away from turning the game pay to win just like that right like it's not happened yet but it could happen don't love it for that reason oh and one thing I absolutely hate about this game is my God the amount of menus and submenus all about like layers and layers of tracking progress with achievements that you have to manually interact with it's let me tell you what I'm talking about right here are the number of different menus and tracking systems it it's nuts so first there is the journey this tracks about just about everything you do in the game from combat to Gathering crafting survival Base building Etc you do the stuff you complete the objectives like backstab backstab enemies five times cook some rare food build and lay in a bed etc etc this will give you rewards it gives you controllers it gives you starcom energy links and XP you have to go into the journey menu and interact with it to get this stuff but then there's also the season goal menu with its own objective tracking for certain tasks similar to the above like Base building exploring and fighting that Awards season specific currency for Cosmetics there is mayf fly's fantastic Journey not the same as the other Journey this is a different Journey this menu also tracks tasks for you to complete in combat survival territory rewarding currencies and consumables there is an event tab that rewards you for making friends and engaging in things like twitch drops there are these things called regular events like the Astro Duets that you accumulate daily and is used to buy consumables there's a community events tab with bonuses rewarded for you linking every single social media site to the game that gives you additional benefits there's the Discord one a whole separate tab for linking your Discord to the game that gives rewards there's then the battle pass with that free and premium track again you have to interact with this to get the rewards every single one of these Beyond like linking your social media accounts are just play the game like fight gather craft doe tasks and then get a currency Resource consumable as a reward but divide it into eight separate menus that you have to interact manually click through and sub menus and go into that menu like it's just like too much it's so unnecessarily convoluted if you want to reward me for playing the game just give me rewards as I play the game having eight different menus and some menus to interact with it is way too much even having one or two things like if they had one or two progress trackers that you had to interact with to collect rewards for completing all these different objectives that's fine they have eight of them eight different menus for just playing the game and then completing a checklist it's just I I hate it I really hate I don't understand why there's eight of these I don't get it uh there was a bunch of other issues like in launch day in particular they had this problem and it wasn't a people are saying bug it wasn't a bug cuz they were explicitly saying before launch you can only make one character on one server surprise people started complaining people jumped in the game they made a character they wanted to try it out and then their friend joins they make a character but they did it on a different server you couldn't make a second character anywhere ever so you just couldn't play with your friend if you accidentally ended up on two servers whoops sorry about that they quickly addressed it I think actually that got patched the same day launch day like immediately so good on them for that another big issue that's resulted in a lot of review bombing and complaints online is the end user license agreement the privacy policy in once human people are pointing to parts of it and saying they're stealing my data from all of the research I've done there was a nice write up and video put out by pirate software I would suggest checking that out if you want further clarification from everything I've read and seen this isn't much different than any other privacy policy that you see in any game people are particularly fearful of some of the Data Tracking and holding on of information that they're doing but again from everything I've seen and read this seems like an odd issue it seems like it's just in line with pretty much every other privacy policy that you see out there I could be wrong though and maybe this privacy policy is in fact going to um have someone steal your identity uh really my answer for this is I'm just not putting any personal information in towards the game I'm not submitting any personal details name whatever you know I'm just going to I'm playing the game through Steam partially for this reason to just not have to worry about it and another one which is kind of more minor but really not uh key mapping is limited for some reason there's lots of things that they do let you rebind the keys but there are just very certain specific things that they don't I don't understand why like why go halfway in on key remapping why let us remap 90% of the keys but then have 10% that you're like oh can't remap this one don't don't understand so they suggestion here just let's key remap everything you you got 90% of the way there get the last 10% right now those complaints like I said there are some or all of these that are going to keep people away from the the game but overall these worries these concerns these complaints have not been enough to stop me from enjoying it I've just been having such a good time I had a great great time during the beta test and now playing again at launch I'm having a blast getting to finally play with all my friends we're building up bases next to each other we're doing content together and I just love the world the content type I love this combination of things the MMO the open world the looter shooter stuff the survival crafting and all put in this world with all this supernatural horror stuff it's just really cool I've been having a great time I really enjoy once human doesn't hurt as well that it's a free-to-play looter game that launched with no pay to win that could of course change in the future but as of today as of this recording there's no pay to win to speak of you're you're all just buying Cosmetics right so that's pretty phenomenal hats off to them they lived up to their word they launched with no pay to win I'm not rolling out that they that they let you buy starcom or controllers in the future or let you pay to skip some of those weakly time Gates that the game has that could certainly happen a few months to a year from now but it's not happening now and now is when I'm enjoying the game so all right by me great that's it for today thank you for watching hope you enjoyed this review of on human I'm having a good time I'm liking it gonna keep on playing at least play through the first season that's my plan here uh hope you enjoyed thanks I'll see you guys next time take it easy",
