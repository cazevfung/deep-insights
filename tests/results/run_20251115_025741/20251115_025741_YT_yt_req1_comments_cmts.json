    "Team ChatGPT or Gemini? Lemme know down below TIMESTAMPS 00:00 I found the Perfect ChatGPT Formula 00:40 The 6 Prompt Components 01:39 Task 02:07 Context 03:05 Exemplars 04:28 Persona 05:18 Format 06:20 Tone 07:05 Example using the Perfect Prompt Formula 08:01 Good vs. Bad Prompt Outputs",
    "Figuring out the amount of context to give ChatGPT has been my BIGGEST frustration; appreciate how you broke this down",
    "Now I watched this video. Then I copied the transcript. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it in a proper format and write the promts I wanted according to this training. The result is beyond perfect.",
    "The best video I ever watched on Prompt Engineering, Fed up with so many videos watching hours of content to find nothing at the end. Just in less than 10 minutes, You conveyed everything. I'm sold at 3rd minute itself. Best example of technical content. Sub'd now",
    "Wasted hours on prompt engineering courses on youtube and did not get anything i didn't know but your 8 minute video teach way more than any other video on YouTube. Keep up the good work.",
    "I love that you talk fast & get to the point quickly. Your use of humor & speed kept my attention and I appreciate this information! Thank you!",
    "1. Task : Start with an action verb. 2. Context: User background, what success looks like, and environment or conditions of user. 3. Examples: Provide examples of the best or real results. It learns very fast through examples. 4. Persona: Act like a ______. (Also add person famous for that). 5. Format: Tell the AI the right output format you want the answer in. 6: Tone: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.",
    "Jeff is a super instructor. He presents detailed content in an easy to understand way, and makes it fun and approachable!",
    "I seriously love this, especially the \"tell it the feeling you want so that it gives you 5 tone keywords you can include in a prompt for ChatGPT\". I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",
    "The simplest solution is to ask ChatGPT what prompts are required to do a certain task. You'll never need Youtube again!",
    "I am one man show starting business soon. I have some involvement with ChatGPT, however now I need to step up. Based on Your video I am creating one page chart to stick on my wall to remind me each time how to build the prompt correctly. Thank You.",
    "Gemini AI: Jeff Su's advice is a good introduction to prompt engineering. It provides a solid foundation and some useful techniques. However, remember that prompting is an art, not a science. The best way to improve your prompts is to practice, experiment, and learn what works best for you and the specific task at hand.",
    "From Chat GPT elements that make a good AI prompt, here are the ones you usually need (others are optional refinements): Role / Perspective – Who should the AI “be”? (e.g., doctor, consultant, teacher). Task / Goal – What exactly do you want done? (summarize, analyze, explain, generate). Context / Input – The information the AI should work with (a passage, data, situation). Constraints / Format – Any rules for the output (word count, style, tone, list, essay). Audience – Who the output is for (kids, experts, general public). At minimum, you only need Task + Context. The others just make results sharper.",
    "Hey Heff Su. Really appreciate you being so professional and delivering top-notch work. Keep rocking it!",
    "Best guy I've found on youtube so far - he gets straight to the point, no fluff, love it!",
    "I wanted to learn prompt engineering so I checked lots of resources on the net, but none of them were as useful and helpful as this video. Thank you so much for creating it.",
    "Thank you sir It's my first time using Chatgpt and this video explains in a precise and concise way how it functions. Cheers from Cameroon 🇨🇲",
    "My advice to all parents is to ensure that your children receive a solid education from primary to high school. This foundational learning is essential for them to be able to effectively use tools like ChatGPT and other AI technologies in the future."
