The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!!

(e.g., doctor, consultant, teacher). Task / Goal – What exactly do you want done? (summarize, analyze, explain, generate). Context / Input – The information the AI should work with (a passage, data, situation). Constraints / Format – Any rules for the output (word count, style, tone, list, essay). Audience – Who the output is for (kids, experts, general public). At minimum, you only need Task + Context. The others just make results sharper.",

It's clear that you've put a lot of effort into understanding and sharing these essential tips for getting the most out of these tools.

In your experience, have you found that there's a sweet spot when it comes to context? How do you avoid going too far and including details that might not actually contribute to the quality of the output? Thanks for sharing your expertise!",
