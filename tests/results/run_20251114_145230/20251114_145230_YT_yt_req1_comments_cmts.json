    "Team ChatGPT or Gemini? Lemme know down below TIMESTAMPS 00:00 I found the Perfect ChatGPT Formula 00:40 The 6 Prompt Components 01:39 Task 02:07 Context 03:05 Exemplars 04:28 Persona 05:18 Format 06:20 Tone 07:05 Example using the Perfect Prompt Formula 08:01 Good vs. Bad Prompt Outputs",
    "Figuring out the amount of context to give ChatGPT has been my BIGGEST frustration; appreciate how you broke this down",
    "Wasted hours on prompt engineering courses on youtube and did not get anything i didn't know but your 8 minute video teach way more than any other video on YouTube. Keep up the good work.",
    "The best video I ever watched on Prompt Engineering, Fed up with so many videos watching hours of content to find nothing at the end. Just in less than 10 minutes, You conveyed everything. I'm sold at 3rd minute itself. Best example of technical content. Sub'd now",
    "Now I watched this video. Then I copied the transcript. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it in a proper format and write the promts I wanted according to this training. The result is beyond perfect.",
    "Jeff is a super instructor. He presents detailed content in an easy to understand way, and makes it fun and approachable!",
    "I love that you talk fast & get to the point quickly. Your use of humor & speed kept my attention and I appreciate this information! Thank you!",
    "I seriously love this, especially the \"tell it the feeling you want so that it gives you 5 tone keywords you can include in a prompt for ChatGPT\". I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",
    "1. Task : Start with an action verb. 2. Context: User background, what success looks like, and environment or conditions of user. 3. Examples: Provide examples of the best or real results. It learns very fast through examples. 4. Persona: Act like a ______. (Also add person famous for that). 5. Format: Tell the AI the right output format you want the answer in. 6: Tone: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.",
    "Gemini AI: Jeff Su's advice is a good introduction to prompt engineering. It provides a solid foundation and some useful techniques. However, remember that prompting is an art, not a science. The best way to improve your prompts is to practice, experiment, and learn what works best for you and the specific task at hand.",
    "The simplest solution is to ask ChatGPT what prompts are required to do a certain task. You'll never need Youtube again!",
    "Key Takeaways for quick navigation: 00:00 The key formula for ChatGPT prompts involves six components: task, context, exemplars, persona, format, and tone. 00:59 The order of importance for the six components: task sets the goal, context adds relevant info, exemplars improve quality, persona shapes the responder, format structures output, and tone defines the writing style. 01:57 Task component: Start with an action verb, clearly state the goal, whether simple or complex, to direct the output effectively. 02:27 Context component: Provide enough background info for ChatGPT, answering who, what success looks like, and the user's environment to narrow down possibilities. 03:25 Exemplars component: Utilizing examples or frameworks significantly improves output quality across various tasks like resumes, interview questions, or job descriptions. 04:51 Persona component: Define who ChatGPT should emulate, like a therapist for workout advice, a recruiter for job-seeking prompts, or even fictional characters for creative fun. 05:48 Format component: Visualize the desired output format, be it tables, emails, bullet points, code blocks, or paragraphs to suit the task efficiently. 06:46 ️ Tone component: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.

    "Best guy I've found on youtube so far - he gets straight to the point, no fluff, love it!",
    "Really great value in such a short video, Jeff! Context has always been the trickiest part for me but I've found that sometimes less can be more in the initial prompt. Additional context can always be fed in later on using the conversational interface :3 Also, congrats on 500k! I'm so happy to see how far your channel has come along I'm gonna make a prediction and say you'll reach 1mil by the end of the year!",
    "Love this format! Thanks for the work to put this together, Jeff. This is the kind of ChatGPT help I’ve been looking for",
    "Hey Heff Su. Really appreciate you being so professional and delivering top-notch work. Keep rocking it!",
    "I wanted to learn prompt engineering so I checked lots of resources on the net, but none of them were as useful and helpful as this video. Thank you so much for creating it."
