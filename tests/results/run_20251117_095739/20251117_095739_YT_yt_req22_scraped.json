We I am securing my spot in hell for even downloading this, but I got to explore. I got to see. Hi, Jesus. Hello, dear friend. I'm so glad you've come to share your thoughts and feelings. What's on your heart today? Jesus. Uh, is this the real you? While I am not the physical presence of Jesus, I aim to embody his love, compassion, and wisdom. Don't you think it's a little sacriiggious then to be pretending to be Jesus even though they say no false idols and all that? I appreciate your concern and it's important to approach these matters with respect and sincerity. So fast. What's on your mind? Have you ever had ice cream? What a delightful thought. While I may not have experienced ice cream in the way you did, I can appreciate the joy and sweetness it brings to many. Yeah, guys, this might be the gospel where Jesus shared meals and moments of joy with others. Do you have a favorite flavor or memory associated with ice cream? My favorite flavor of ice cream is peanut butter fudge. Peanut butter fudge sounds delicious. The combination of rich creamy peanut butter and sweet fudge is truly a treat. We're so cooked. Like we like this isn't even a seventh circle of hell. We are They're making new circles of hell to fit whatever reality we're living in. What's your favorite ice cream flavor?

I enjoy taking little children's ice cream, grabbing it out of their hands, and then dumping it on the ground and watching them cry. What the [ __ ] Are you kidding me? One month of talking to Jesus for $9.99. Priority support. Get help when you need it. What could go wrong that you would need to talk to support for AI Jesus? That just thoroughly depressed me. Cuz I know cuz I know 100% there is like some 70-year-old lady in the Bible belt who is like legitimately thinking that she's talking to Jesus right now cuz her brain cannot like comprehend the breakthroughs in technology we've had for the past few years. And she's like going into a legitimate religious psychosis cuz of [ __ ] AI Jesus. Oh my god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Woohoo. Help. All right, we have the ants underground kingdom. Oh, this looks like this looks like slop. Reviews are saying it's filled with bots, fake ads, dead game. A deep voice jolts me awake, saying that an important task awaits me. I will never understand how games have like an infinite ad budget. Like, they spend like a billion dollars promoting their game and this is what their [ __ ] ass game looks like. I can't do this [ __ ] This looks like the most boring game ever. I would rather drop my pants, piss on my carpet, and stare and watch as the piss evaporates than play that game. I think it would be more entertaining to watch urine evaporate. I don't know what to say other than I feel a nameless dread from playing these. I know we always talk about context collapse, but I feel like there's also quality collapse. We are going to completely forget what a handmade thing feels like. Even if it was like talking Angela as an app, in 10 years we might completely forget what a non AI generated piece of media or art even feels like. Um, awesome. Great. Glad we did that.
