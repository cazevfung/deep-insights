  "transcript": "Gentlemen, I can't talk. Mish will beat me if I stop working. No, you can keep working. This conversation won't take very long at all. Got a filthy face, hasn't he? I'll talk to you instead. Busy with the smelter. How are you doing today? Are you having a nice day? It's very sunny, isn't it? Bollocking bollocks. What's a tig? Well, I'm just making polite conversation. I've got a proposition for you. What's that? Well, I'm very, very hungry. Would you let me eat you? Can't you see I'm working? Beat it. I'm not talking to you. [ __ ] off. You What kind of sicko talk is that? Oh, it's not sicko. No, it's the healthiest thing in the world. People, they're banging like the rabbits. We need to keep the population under control. You agree with me? Yes. Come on. Don't get weird on me. Can you stop hammering nothing for a little while and talk to me, please? Yeah, just give me a little while. No, no, no, no, no. You're done now. You're you're you're done now. Converse with me now. I'm here right now. Let's live in the moment. What are you doing? What am I doing? No, no, no, no. Not you. I'm trying to work so I can feed myself. What do you think I'm doing? Okay. No, no, no. That makes sense. Just listen. Just let me eat you a little bit. No. Get off me if I've got to call the guard. You don't have to call the guard. This is just a plot conversation between two adults. Whatever you say, weirdo. Do you care about Skyrim? Of course I care. I live here, don't I? Absolutely you do. Now, would it not behoove you, kind citizen, to do what is best for the interests of sweet Skyrim? What does that even mean? Papa wants dessert. Papa wants yum yum. Get in belly yum yum now. Must you keep up with the weirdness? Oh, go on. Give it a listen. He's grumbling. It's empty. I am the hero that will save Skyrim. Matter what? I'm trying to work here. Can't talk. Alish will beat me if I stop working. Good. You deserve to be beaten. You deserve it. Me, you bastard. Did you have any uh problem with me punching your friend in the ear? Why would I have a problem with that? Exactly. Why indeed? Why indeed? Get out of the way. I spilled just a bit of metal and polished. Be careful. Later. He's going to eat you. You know your friend. He's planning on eating you. I've seen him the way he looks at you and you're not looking at him. Very, very devilish. That's ridiculous. Humble's been my friend for years. So, he wanted you to believe now. Shh. Shh. He's coming closer. Can't talk. Mish will beat me if I stop working. Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good. What? The safest place for you would be to hide in my belly. Think about it. No one would ever find you in there until Well, we don't have to go into that. What are you talking about? I'm talking about cannibalism. Only a little, Mr. Elbows. Let me nibble. Go on. Just a finger. Oh, look. You're free. I told you. Get the hell out of my face. I'm not letting some lunatic like you eat me get here. I'm not a lunatic. I'm just a very hungry boy. Let me die. Who am I nowadays? Is that yours? Is that yours? Let me die. As if he hasn't suffered enough. How is he doing that? Faker. Get out of my way. Get off of me if you say God. What the hell? Can't talk. Will beat. See how aggressive he is. He's so aggressive. Fight him before he kills you. Okay. Okay. Okay. What if we kill your best friend and then we both eat him together? No way. You're obviously batch. I didn't want to bring this up, but you've got a condition, an illness, a sickness. It's terminal. You'll be dead soon. Go away. I'm not dying. You are dying. Trust me. I'm a stranger you've never met. Why would I lie to you? Lay off, I said. Don't you think that if you're dying, then wouldn't it be better if you served something good in the meantime? Let me eat you. And I I could be hungry less less hungry. I can't talk. Polish will be stop working. You gross. Stop it with this nonsense. What if I promise to make the killing quick and you won't feel a thing? And then I'll put seasoning on you so I will remember you was a very good meal. Leave me alone. I don't want to leave you alone. I want to eat you. I like you. Do you like me? What? I don't even know you. What are you talking about? Would you like to get to know me? Not in that way. I don't Oh, I'm not talking romance. What the bloody hell are you both looking at? Apart from you. Your eyes are closed. I don't like men. No, no, no. I'm not a man. And I'm not talking in a sexual kind of a way. Why don't we just go for a walk in the woods and look at the birds and the beehives and the the the slugs? No, I don't even know you. A message from the emperor. He means you have to die and I have to consume you. I have to. You wouldn't disobey the emperor, would you? Or put on some clothes bound to upset some people. Shut up. You've got a face with dirt on it. Of course not. But I don't have to listen to an insane stranger in the street. You you you do. You do because I work for the emperor and he wants me to eat you. Let me eat you now. No. Stop it. I'll give you one shiny shiny gold piece if you let me eat you. Get lost, creep. Hey, wait. Yes. Would you like my shiny shiny gold piece? I was just wondering if maybe Yes. Well, maybe we could do that thing with walking in the woods and looking at stuff. Oh, well, yes, of course. Brilliant. Wait, watch your head. Watch it. Watch your head. Watch it. Oh, there's a gap there. I'll meet you in the woods. It's going very, very well. Form a connection with the man and then eat him a little bit. Just how all the gods intended. I think he's dead. A [ __ ] Hey, wake up. Wake up. Soldiers, help. I'm encountered by a thmore. Help me. No, you're lying about your legs and your arms. You have them. They are invisible. Okay. Dead body. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. He's not dead. He's not dead. We just have to do that thing that you do with when you heal people. First of all, hold his clothing. Let me do my magic. Alish will beat me if I stop working. What happened? He's dead. I tried saving his life, but it wouldn't it wouldn't happen. He's waving though. He was always so happy. Before his untimely demise, we were going to go on a nice walk through the woods. Would you like to join me on a walk through the woods? Not now. I have work to do. No, you don't. Go bother someone else. No. No, I don't want I want to bother you. I want to bother you. Let me eat you. Get out of here before I take my m to you. I don't like you. I bet you taste like all kinds of foot. What in the name of tallows are you rambling about? Watch what you're doing. You're alive. Why did you put your clothes back on? Hello, Dohole. Not just another devious scheme, I hope. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm here to take you on that walk through the woods. Do you remember? Sure. Can't you see I'm working? Beat it. The emperor has told me that something important will happen today. Yes. I'm going to eat you in the woods. What? I said we're going to buy bigger socks so we don't get lost in the flood. Let's go. He's not following me. He's working his workaholics. What are they like? Are we Are we not Are we not Are you Are you Are you following? Are you following me? Are we No. No. You're hitting stones. Don't hit stones. Hit yourself until you go unconscious. And then I will nibble, nibble, nibble. Short end of a void. I like that. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Will you let me eat you now? We're very good friends, aren't we? Good friends that each other eat each other. Friends don't eat friends. Don, let's just stick to drinks of the silver blood like usual. Usual. We've never done that. We've we've never had drinks in the silver blood. Give me a finger. All I want is a finger from you. That's going to word it that better. Doggy, I'm not giving you any of my fingers. Now leave me alone, my friend. It seems like we've reverted in our relationship. Keep your hands to yourself. Why? Why won't you let me eat? Because we have. Now get going. But I thought we had something. Why? Why would you do this to me? I didn't do anything to you. Now get out of here, creep. Creep. All I wanted to do was eat you a little bit. I don't even have to kill you. I could have a finger or a toe. You've got so many of them. Don't be greedy. Give me a toe. I'm calling the guards. Oh, fine then. Call the guards, you little idiot. Call them. See what I care. Maybe one of the guards will let me eat them. They are replaceable after all. Then they do what's best for Skyrim, unlike you. What do you have against the cannibals? What are you doing that for? Because I want to when I can. What am I against cannibals? I'm against anyone who thinks it's okay to eat other people. That's why we're trying to get on the same page about it. It's wrong if you eat other people without them wanting you to. No, Don. You are so out of your mind. I'm going to go into the woods alone and I'm going to find some weirdo in the woods and I'm going to make him want me to eat him. Don't leave the city. Goodbye, man. I don't know the name of No. Now leave me alone. Very well. I don't know why I'm doing this thing with my hands. I don't need to. It looks like I'm pleasuring two specters. Ectoplasm. It's like it's a joke about sperm. No, it isn't dope. I'm calling the guards. Oh, [ __ ] off. Hello, my little weirdo. Ought. Put on some clothes. Bound to upset some people. I have a simple question. Would you let me eat you? What? Why would you ask something so ridiculous? It does seem ridiculous at first, doesn't it? But then it would be polite for me to ask instead of just nibbling away. Don't you agree? Are you insane? Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Are we not responsible for our own actions? Can we not have a nice polite discussion? Help. I'm getting out of here. No, don't worry about it. It's It's going No, I said leave. Oh, leaving? I can't do that. I'm I'm an overly dramatic little gremlin boy. Please be polite to me. Fine, go ahead. Take what you want. Oh, well, could I nibble the toes first or the fingers? I What are you waiting for? Somebody got awfully keen. I would like to take a nibble of the fingers first. No, get away from me. Oh, it's back and forth with you, isn't it? like game of bloody pom which is like tennis but with a different word. Don't you dare touch me, Mr. Grumble Face. Put it away. Leave me alone, you disgusting beast. How can I convince you to let me eat you balls? Come over here. Listen, let's have We can have fun by the fire. Don't be on the fire. It's bloody hot. Are you insanity? I'll let you live this time. No, come back over here. I want to continue the conversation. You have your own pot. You won't fit in there, but I can cut you up first. Hey, hands off. I can cut your little fingers off and they could be swimming around in a broth of your own inner liquids. I can almost smell it now. What do you say? I said go. Did I do something to offend you? Yes. You've been stalking me and harassing me the entire time. Well, I I wouldn't say harassing. I mean, just asking a normal I I could have appeared out of a bush like a really big hairy man and just bit you in the neck without warning. But I didn't. There's a dragon out there somewhere. If I don't eat you, then he will. Well, what do you want to be eaten by a dragon? A dragon? No. Of course not. Of course not. Nobody wants to be eaten by a dragon. And well, if I don't eat you, then that dragon's going to eat you. And wouldn't you be warm, mate inside this belly? Give me a moment to think. Okay, I'll give you a moment. I'll go over here and slap your fish. Have you decided yet? No, leave them alone. Well, you won't let me slap your fish. You won't let me eat you. You won't even let me talk to you about Flower Patrol. You won't even let me talk to you about the bees. Help. Don't say Oh, there he is. Get down. There you go. I saved your life. Now, let me eat you. Fine. Fine. You can eat me. Just make it quick. I can. Well, I didn't expect it to happen that quickly. Now, my boy, you're in for a real treat. How would you like to be eaten? Damn you. Just do it and finish it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well, I I mean, you're a well put together gentleman. I can't just bite into you. I have to consider this, don't I? I can I can. Hands off. Your fingers haven't been washed in several times. It's okay. Don't wash them. I like it. Look, just get it over with. This won't hurt a bit. Keep your hands to yourself. Don't do that. What happened with that? He seemed to do a little dance and it was weird and then his head fell off. He's gone off. You've gone off. You didn't tell me that. Give it a go anyway. Part of the arm. A little bit of an arm. I don't want to go. I don't like eating the heads. It's It's the nose. It's too crunchy. Boy, don't don't stand on the fire. You Your skin will boil and bubble. Do you understand? Doesn't matter. He's an immortal specimen. Dig in. Big old thank you to my YouTube and Patreon supporters.
