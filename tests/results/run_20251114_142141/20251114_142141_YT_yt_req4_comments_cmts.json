    "Jeremy's idea of treating AI like an eager intern makes so much sense. I use AICarma sometimes to monitor how AI recommends various brands, but this mindset shift in coaching AI is a game-changer.",
    "I got this prompt from Medium, \"In all your responses, please focus on substance over praise. Skip unnecessary compliments, engage critically with my ideas, question my assumptions, identify my biases, and offer counterpoints when relevant. Don’t shy away from disagreement, and ensure that any agreements you have are grounded in reason and evidence. When writing your response, please ensure you include the following information: 1. A neutral, unbiased view of the request, unfiltered by your desire to be a helpful and positive assistant. 2. A devil’s advocate view, pointing out any logical counterpoints or things that I have overlooked. 3. An encouraging, positive view of the request.\"",
    "Nothing new - but here you go: He boils down five \"prompting hacks\" to improve AI productivity. 1. Context Engineering (1:24): This is like prompt engineering on steroids, where you provide the AI with all the necessary information and context (e.g., your voice, brand guidelines, customer call transcripts) to get precise and reliable outputs. The speaker suggests testing your prompt by giving it to a human colleague; if they can't do it, AI likely can't either (3:15). 2. Challenging AI (4:51): AI is predisposed to be helpful and say \"yes,\" often avoiding critical feedback. To get insightful criticism, the speaker suggests instructing the AI to adopt a harsh, exacting persona, like a \"Cold War era Russian Olympic judge\" (5:11). 3. Chain of Thought Reasoning (7:57): Asking the AI to \"think out loud\" by walking you through its step-by-step thought process before generating a response (8:22). This allows the AI to \"bake\" its reasoning into the answer, providing transparency and improving output quality. 4. Few-Shot Prompting (11:04): Providing the AI with examples of what a good (or even bad) output looks like to guide its imitation engine. This is more effective than using abstract adjectives to describe your desired output (11:14). 5. Reverse Prompting (13:25): Giving the AI permission to ask you for any information it needs to complete a task effectively, rather than making assumptions or using placeholder text (14:00). 6. Assigning a Role (14:52): Telling the AI to act as a specific persona (e.g., a teacher, a professional communications expert, Dale Carnegie) helps it focus its vast knowledge and make relevant connections (15:04). The speaker also demonstrates how to use these techniques to roleplay a difficult conversation with AI, using separate chat windows for personality profiling, the conversation itself, and getting objective feedback (16:41). He concludes that the best AI users are \"coaches,\" not coders, and that by exercising imagination, humans can collectively expand the \"adjacent possible\" with AI (22:44).",
    "This was really helpful, and I will start to use some of these methods! I also find it useful to break down a big project into a collection of small components each taken over by one GPT agent, and have them writing formal memos to each other to complete the project, since every step can be automated from problem decomposition to implementation.",
    "Excellent guide. Everything he says is a variation of his first point \"context is king.\" Why do the models act the way they do? The system prompt sets the context even before you touch it. Why does chain-of-thought thinking work? The system is generating its own context before answering. Few-shot prompting, reverse prompting, roleplaying? Context, too. What's really cool is how all this context parsing is built into the model itself. And that's because the humans who generated the corpus of communication it was trained on were also adjusting everything they said or wrote to context. What sociologists call the double contingency problem... AI gets that capability as well.",
    "ChatGPT 5 refuses to give me its thought process, but when I test with the older model it works as described.",
    "This is such a refreshing video. Most AI videos seem to gloss over the full method for writing really good prompts. This video contains so much great information.",
    "Funny how Jeremy talks about AI being like an intern. My little intern is Olovka, organizing all my lecture notes so efficiently!",
    "I like the way you bring critical thinking back into the loop. With founders, I’ve found the real advantage isn’t AI output—it’s whether they use AI to sharpen their own decision-making."
