    "Book version is now available on Amazon and LeanPub! This is like an in-depth version of the video, with more content, examples, case-studies, prompt engineering tips, Ai transformation leadership, etc. https://www.amazon.com/Generative-AI-Nutshell-Survive-Thrive-ebook/dp/B0DSBFN12W/ https://leanpub.com/ainutshell",
    "How wonderful that we live in a time where incredible content like this is available for free on the internet",
    "I have done 11+ course (around 40+ hours) on Generative AI and LLMs but let me tell you 70% of that was covered in this tiny 18 minute video, This video is so simple and so informative, feels illegal to be free. Thanks Henrik great work!",
    "I never ever ever comment, but you sir have earned my respect and gratitude. Clear, crisp, concise, positive and a clear CTA for all of us. Many thanks",
    "One of the most clarifying, comprehensive, helpful, insightful videos I 've seen on this topic. Really excellent.",
    "I've worked in and around AI since the mid-90s, and this is one of the best explanations of the current state-of-the-art I've seen. It's a semester course crammed into eighteen minutes. I'm sharing this with a long list of people. Thanks!",
    "I am a computer science and AI student. There can't be a better explanation of AI than this; wonderful work.",
    "man, your ability to explain it using simple drawings and paint the full picture in just 17 minutes is frikin amazing! Guys like you are rare. Keep going, compadre!",
    "I am amazed how well you structured everything.... and sharing the drawing is unexpected. Congrats and many thanks!",
    "BeLikeNative helps me break down complex AI concepts into clear, concise writing that’s easy to understand. I use BeLikeNative to improve my grammar and save time, ensuring I communicate effectively in the age of AI.",
    "I hope this video gets seen by a lot more people, it's one of the best AI related videos I've seen! Super clear and informative and has a lot of charm with the drawings",
    "The idea of autonomous agents using tools brings to mind the cautionary themes in \"The Brain Center at Whipple's.\" Both deal with the consequences of relying too heavily on technology, and how it can spiral into unintended outcomes. It’s a reminder to balance innovation with careful thought about its long-term impact.",
    "YT suggested your video. When i saw picture of cartoon type illustration, I said this is for me! I am a visual person. Well, true enough. Your 17min video explained crystal clear what I have learned the past many weeks on AI from YT. Many other videos don't actually explained like you do. Bravo and thank you very much for taking tons of hours making this illustration and explanation. It has helped me heaps. I have now recommended my high school going daughter to watch this video to help her with her understanding.",
    "This is easily the best explanation on generative AI that I have see. Thanks for this!",
    "ChatGPT GPT stands for \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer.\" Generative: It can create (or generate) text based on input. Pre-trained: It has been trained on vast amounts of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. Transformer: It is based on a type of neural network architecture called the Transformer, which is great for understanding and generating human-like text. So, ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT technology, designed to understand and respond to text-based conversations.",
    "Aaah Henrik! Trust you to come up with a clear, entertaining, useful, rich video that demystifies and appeals to individuals of all ages, stages and walks of life, in under 20 mins! My groupie status continues! Sharing far and wide! Thank you!!!!",
    "As a business analyst I am really scared of the AI replacing me in this capitalistic world. But after watching this video I’ve decided to give it a shot at least in helping me with some documents I have to fill in daily at work. Still not convinced that AI is good for the society but now I understand it a bit more. Thank you!",
    "I have been teaching AI for elderly people who is curious and/afraid here in sweden. They might not ever use it again but they now know enough to have a coversation about AI.",
    "great intro video to ai! as someone working in the ai industry, i rly appreciate how you made complex concepts accessible. one thing to add - the ai landscape has evolved quite a bit since jan. nowadays we have unified ai platforms (like jenova ai) that handle model selection automatically, so users dont need to worry about choosing between different ai models for different tasks. makes it even easier for beginners to get started! love the drawings btw, makes everything super clear",
    "This video was absolutely useful, people who are currently learning prompt engineering will be the OGs of prompt engineering. Generative AI brings more light into the phrase \"Work smart not hard\".",
    "GREAT video - and that is a cheering sort of yell! Kudos to you on seeing a new opportunity/challenge and good fortune on the endeavor.",
    "Wow, on to the point and easy to understand and the visuals are mind blowing.",
    "I’ll give this video three more thumbs up We need more of your talent here Henrik!. Congrats!!!",
    "Superbly done. Best intro to the whole topic I've come across. Thank you!",
    "One of the most comprehensive, superbly explained, insightful videos I've even seen on this topic, with lot of humor in between! Really excellent.",
    "Henrik, THANK YOU. pProbably one of the BEST videos on Youtube. Not just on AI BUT the best in terms of how you describe, draw and speak to explain this topic. Can you Please do more videos in this similar fashion and also design and deliver paid training online courses on prompt engineering and All Things AI. Thank you again.",
    "one of the best videos on YouTube simplifying what Gen AI is and how it works..",
    "Also thanks for spelling out that this is basically what brings food on your table, so it is easier to understand how much of this is just overhyped and made just so other people get in this craze. BTW you should revise this video after a year, as it didn't age very well... Deepseek and other free products are now accessible locally; and you can just ask locally to your new model to make a course about AI, so we made basically irrelevant not only programmers (LOL I wish that AI was able to make what a developer does, top to bottom), but also teachers.",
    "Generative AI - Everything from evolution to what it is, how to use it and what next (future) in a Nutshell ... really very well compiled content within 18 mins. Hats off !!",
    "Brilliant content, PERFECT pacing! All this information and I never felt distracted nor did I feel overwhelmed. Thanks a lot",
    "Thanks for taking the time to produce this brilliant summary Henrik. I'm going to practice my prompting like you suggest. Exciting times ahead if we approach it positively and remain vigilant to the possible pitfalls.",
    "This type of dynamic, animated drawing video - What is the tool or technique or software product and skills behind it? What do I need to learn, what tools to use to prepare similar video to present My ideas?",
    "It's great, it feels wonderful, especially the example of Labub. I like it a lot."
