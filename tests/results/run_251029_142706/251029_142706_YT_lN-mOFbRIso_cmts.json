    "singleplayer is where im at, from playing hunt showdown and some others, i realised i suck, theres no amount of get good that can help my old hands. zero seivert has been great fun, but im ready to try some new stuff now, so this video is really helpful",
    "0:20 game 1: Escape From Tarkov PvE. 9:00 game 2: incursion red river. 20:19 game 3: Hole 27:41 game 4: The forever winter 34:59 game5: escape from duckov. 40:10 game 6: zero sievert Hope this helps anyone wondering.",
    "Forever winter is soooo good, but it definitly needs a lot more time to cook",
    "The unpredictability of Tarkov ai is insane. Sometimes they stand there and say hi before firing. Sometimes both your arms and legs are gone as soon as they spot you",
    "It took BSG a pretty damn long while to get bots to the current state from the start of Tarkov PvE, but they really feel good now. PMCs tend to infight if they're from different factions, they go after bosses, scavs/raiders/rogues spread out more gradually than usual, they will push you aggressively or decide to leave you if you disappear for too long or hit back hard enough. Big leap from being walking laser turrets. Especially now that vegetation and debris finally obscure their vision and they generally behave more naturally; previously every run basically turned into Mogadishu simulator of you sitting in a room fighting off waves of scavs with occasional PMC surprise. If not for the price (and some quests being a pain in the ass) it would be damn near perfect. Or you can just play SPT.",
    "PSA: Incursion Red River will have a major update (1.2.0.0) on June 25. Can't wait for it, the game is fantastic.",
    "$70 to play tarkov pve is still cheaper than the $150 i spent on the game for EOD",
    "If you're looking to do another episode in the future Quasimorph is another one you might wanna check out, it's a turn based single player extractor that's fun and really challenging",
    "Zero seivert is like tarkov/stalker top down, it’s really underrated and fun. Tweaking the settings to make the game harder or easier is really enjoyable",
    "Great Video Ramen, I am definitely gonna try ZERO Sievert soon because of this video. Although a small gripe I have with Singeplayer Extraction shooters is that most of these games don't have a story. It would be cool to see a singleplayer extraction shooter with an actual narrative similar to an RPG where decisions actually matter and it isn't just a repeat of go in, shoot, loot, and leave. I can totally see some of these games (Most likely the forever winter) having this but let's wait for their release.",
    "Im not gonna lie, I was losing my mind with you in that darn tarkov spawn I was yelling for you to be brave and push",
    "watching him rack the slide in Hole when the chamber isn't empty gives me chuckle",
    "A tip for Zero Sievert, turn the grass down to about 1/4th of the bar. It looks really nice but it hides every enemy you've finished off. Crows will land on their bodies as a visual indicator, but even the crows get hidden behind the grass. It's a much better experience with less grass, even if it doesn't look as nice. It'd be nice if the dev would add some options to hide specific things behind the grass, like living NPCs, loot containers, unalive NPCs, Crows, and just let the player adjust it how they'd like to experience the game, so we could keep the grass on but still actually find the loot we earned.",
    "The Forever Winter is amazing and deserves attention. The atmosphere and art design are out of this world. Definitely the game to keep an eye on. I've been following it for a while now",
    "HOLE is amazing once you start to unlock things, and also tbh is kind of the scariest at times.",
    "GRAY ZONE WARFARE should definately be on this list. It's heavily PvE focused, has PvE only servers, you can play most quests (GZW calls it tasks) solo, and you can play co-op with a full squad. Either friends, or just team up with people on the server. It's an open world, no loading screens, no time limit for raids, as long as you eat/drink, you can explore as long as you want. Feels like a more hardcore Ghost Recon / Far Cry. Lots of fun clearing and looting bases, bunkers and cities. Graphics are fantastic...especially jungle /foliage. Update 0.4 will bring more story quests / lore to the game...probably in november.",
    "the way you walk when you hear people shows your pvp muscle memory kicking in XD",
    "the \"dancy\" movment every tarkover knows and does is giving me vertigo when watching someone else do it",
    "Gray Zone Warfare offers a similar concept. It can be played purely PVE and is great fun!",
    "Hole was such a surprise for me, I got it almost blindly and threw myself in, I was instantly hooked! The little slide mechanic is such a small detail, but makes you feel SOOOOOO good when you pull it off well, when you get into the rhythm, you feel in sync with your weapon. Some may call it a gimmick, I would love to see it implemented in other games as well, it is that satisfying (especially on the sniper rifle)",
    "Zero sievert is slowly becoming my favorite game as well. It took me awhile to get into it but once you figure it out, there is a lot To experience.",
    "Incursion red river got updated recently and as a tarkov player I must say... I am adicted to red river right now",
    "I was so engaged by that Tarkov clip that I completely forgot what video I was watching",
    "The Forever Winter reminds me of that one mission from the OG CoD MW2 \"The Enemy of my enemy\", where Soap and Price try to escape a plane boneyard trying to dodge both Shadow Company and Makarov's henchmen (don't believe they were called Konni back then) and just survive. You dodge the gunfight or fight your way through if needed while doing missions to one of the factions. Quite interesting idea.",
    "background music in this vid sounds like the division but in cyberpunk, love the skyscraper vibes",
    "DUDE I love Hole! Its so simple and fun to enjoy, but can also be super intense after staying in \"raid\" too long! 5/5 for me! Glad to see more people finding it and giving it a try!",
    "43:06 - Zero Sievert is the definition of addictive. Easy to get into, hard to master. Easy to crashout and not play it for a week, easy to jump right back into. Deep enough to make ya wanna dive, but not so deep that it's scary. Love that they listened to us and made the \"true experience\" a harder difficulty - now newbs don't just lose all their gear after 2 deaths early game. Gotta enable that intentionally lol.",
    "there's also quasimorph if you wanna try a grid based type extraction game with a sorta body horror enemy type twist",
    "dude \"hole\" is fun as fuck if youre looking for a cozy game just for fun, but you still like intense shooting. its perfect to listen to a podcast or something along side it",
    "The tarkov bots running around looting and doing their own thing was fun to watch.",
    "I redownloaded Escape from Tarkov and snatched up the PvE thanks to this video and I’ve been having fun for a week straight now. Thanks for the recommendation, you got yourself a sub.",
    "Not a mil sim like extraction shooter, but that game does have some extraction shooter elements. It's a mix of souls like, extraction shooter and rogue lite: Witchfire . It's still in early access, but it's an incredibly good game already with a very interesting game play loop. I suggest you to check that one out, too! :)",
    "dang Incursion Red River also just got a major update. added a shit ton of weapons and completely remade the quarry map."
