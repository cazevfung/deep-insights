  "transcript": "GTA 6 is about to change everything when it comes to NPCs we're talking about the most advanced AI system ever seen in an open world game one that makes the NPCs actually drive like real people no more random crashes at intersections no more cars despawning the second you turn around and no more police smashing into walls like they just learned how to drive Rockstar has patented an entire new system for virtual navigation and this is the real deal NPCs will now react to traffic weather roadblocks police chases and even make smart driving decisions based on the conditions around them this isn't just a small upgrade this is a Next Level immersion that could make GTA 6 feel more alive than any game before and today we're breaking it all down but before we do that make sure to hit the like button subscribe and if you haven't already turn on notifications so you don't miss a GTA6 update all right let's get into it first let's talk about how NPCs work in GTA 5 because let's be real they weren't exactly Geniuses in GTA 5 traffic followed preset paths based on nodes essentially invisible waypoints all over the map that told NPCs where to go these nodes had basic metadata like speed limits and Road width and the AI just blindly followed them without much thought this is why NPCs ignored traffic conditions they didn't care if the road was packed with cars they just kept driving forward no matter what they had no memory of past decisions every movement was based on a single frame meaning there was Zero long-term planning they despawned constantly NPCs weren't exactly alive in the world if they weren't in your immediate area they just vanished to save processing power police AI was laughable cops would just Ram into you smash into walls and cause more destruction than actual criminals this system worked for its time but in an era where open world games are becoming more complex GTA 6 needed something far more advanced now let's talk about how Rockstar is fixing all of this with their new patented system and it's quite a name this system is called the system and method for virtual navigation in a gaming environment yeah the name's pretty crazy but what does it actually do this system can completely overhauls NPC Behavior making them more aware reactive and dynamic than ever before here's what it brings to the table NPCs will react to realtime traffic conditions if a road is packed they'll actually reroute instead of just forcing their way through like maniacs weather will affect driving behavior if it's raining expect NPCs to drive slower take safer routes and avoid high-risk roads NPCs will actually switch lanes properly before a highway exit instead of making last minute decisions from the left lane all the way to the right police chases cops won't just slam into cars blindly anymore they'll maneuver through traffic intelligently and actually pursue suspects realistically traffic will be denser without lagging the game this new system is way more efficient so Rockstar can fill the streets with cars while keeping things smooth this means no more scripted robotic NPCs everyone in GTA 6 will act like real people making the game feel way more immersive all right so now we've talked about how NPCs will be smarter but what does that actually mean for gameplay traffic jams will actually make sense ever been in GTA 5 and see a random cluster of cars just smashing into each other that's because the old AI didn't understand how to navigate real traffic in GTA 6 expect actual congestion where NPCs will slow down find alternate routes and even honk at each other police chases will feel more like a real movie scene in GTA 5 police were aggressive but dumb they had no strategy just Brute Force but now cops will actually swerve through traffic properly they'll cut you off set up roadblocks and use realistic tactics if traffic is too dense they might even call in helicopter instead of mindlessly ramming you what do you mean by that weather will change how you drive if it starts raining or storming NPCs will drive slower use their wipers and avoid risky roads if there's flooding some NPCs might even turn around instead of risking getting stuck reckless drivers and unique AI personalities some NPCs will be more aggressive speeding through red lights tailgating or even getting road rage others might be overly cautious slowing down too much waiting forever at stop signs or even honking at bad drivers for for the first time NPCs will actually have driving personalities making the world feel more unpredictable and real now let's go even deeper because this system might not just be about traffic pedestrians might be smarter too if Rockstar is applying this AI system to Vehicles it makes sense that pedestrians will also get an intelligence boost will people react realistically to crimes Will They Run for Cover differently based on the situation could we see realistic crowds forming when something crazy happens a more living and breathing world if Rockstar is making NPCs this Advanced then the world itself has to be more reactive too will news reports cover traffic incidents could NPCs remember past events and react differently later could we see Dynamic construction zones that change over time we don't have all the answers yet but one thing's clear Rockstar is pushing the boundaries of open world AI like never before this new NPC system is going to make GTA 6 feel unlike any game before it we're talking about a world where traffic flows realistically police chases feel cinematic NPCs have actually ual driving Styles and whether actually changes how the world reacts this isn't just another GTA this is Rockstar changing the game entirely but now I want to hear from you do you think this will be the most realistic open world AI ever could this system make GTA 6 too realistic or will it still be fun and what other features do you think Rockstar is hiding from us drop your thoughts in the comments below and before you go smash that like button subscribe and turn on notifications so you don't miss any GTA 6 updates thank you so much for watching and I'll catch you in the next one he",
