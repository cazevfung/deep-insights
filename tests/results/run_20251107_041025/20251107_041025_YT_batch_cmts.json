This uniqueness came from the imagination and inspirations of the game developpers. For the moment the AI is just a tool for game developpers but it makes us wonder if some day it will be able to produce on its own original ideas and manage to create better games than game devs...

What hit me like a truck is that, very very soon, we will see creative industries that mimic… the egg industry. No, not because both have stuff that fire out of our backsides (though, I’m sure you’ve all got a publisher in mind that you could argue does that) - but because, to me, generative AI is a bit like those ultra-inhumane, cruel chicken batteries where they basically squeeze forty eggs out of a raggedy hen each day, and you get charged pennies to have them. Some people will buy them, because… well, that’s the most eggs you can get for your money, so who cares how you got them? More eggs, and nobody needs to think too hard about how we got them. Others, however, are willing to spend a bit more to know the hens were fed chocolate gateau and given massages, and despite them costing a bit more, you can REALLY tell the difference (and, besides - you get to feel good, knowing you supported a kinder, more thoughtful world). As this scales beyond the point of any reasonable control, there’ll be an “artisan resurgence” in the games industry, and “all human-made” will be a badge of honour. No doubt, there’ll be associated costs there (though I doubt the AAA folks will sacrifice profit to bring down game RRPs, we’ll likely see bigger games take less time to make as more and more genAI is shoehorned in - human-made games will take longer, and that’ll be the tradeoff). Do you choose the battery farmed eggs, or the organic, free-range ones? Do you choose the rapidly-built AI games, or the more methodical, time-hungry human-made ones? Ultimately, that boils down to what you want - if you just want game fast, at any cost, or if you’d rather your games were built with every facet considered with human intention. (on the topic of food - in my personal opinion, generative AI is a bit like pee in a pot of soup. How much pee in your pot of soup do you like? How much will you tolerate? Some people might not care, so long as they can’t taste it. For me, just knowing ANY in there is enough to make me order a salad instead.)

Turns out that he had went the long way around and was pursuing me from behind, and then he shot me in the back. Another game that impressed me was Killzone 2. If you shoot enemies they take cover, and if you keep shooting they don't pop up and shoot. Instead they lift their guns above the cover and fire blindly in the direction they think you are in. If you stop firing they quickly check by popping out their heads. So what I did was that I sprinted around a bunch of junk and came up beside the guy. He still turned around and checked behind himself to see if I was still there. Then he turned his head towards me and stated \"SHIT.\" A third example is in Crysis, the most tense and immersive fight I ever had in an FPS. There is this small cemetry in the forest where you are supposed to extract. Yet in this area there are four enemies with nanosuits, sniper rifles and SMGs. In case you are unaware of what this means, they are invisible and once you shoot them they switch to armour. Taking a whole magazine of bullets without dropping. But since I was already aware of them being in the area I cloaked and snuck towards the place. Lying beneath a bush and trying to spot the camoflaged enemies through the damp mist. Occasionally I could see someone in the distance, sitting as their nanosuit regained its energy. More often I heard their footsteps but couldn't see them. If you make any noise they begin to quitely track you down. And if you are revealed you can expect fire from all direction and die. It probably took over an hour as I tried to sneak closer and closer to an individual enemy, then broke stealth and emptied a magazine of incendiary ammo into one. Then stealthed as I snuck away to hide under another bush. One by one, bush and tree, step by step until I had found every single one. This enemy was intelligent and had the proper tools to fight you on equal terms. It was terrifying and enjoyable.",
