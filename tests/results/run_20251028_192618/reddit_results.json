(Long read) : r/ArcRaiders\nCommunity for ARC Raiders. An upcoming multiplayer, extraction adventure, set in a lethal future earth, ravaged by a mysterious mechanized threat known as ARC.\nDoes anyone else think the Extraction genre is the next big thing in gaming? (Long read)\nThe Extraction genre has crazy growth potential.\nThe Extraction genre has limited growth potential.\nThe Extraction Shooter is gamings new \"Mario 64 moment\". A hack media outlet use this term on an Astro Bot Rescue Mission back in 2018. That milk is now chunky and black.\nAn Extraction Shooter is s a PvP RPG. The premise of the genre is building your characters power over a length of time. You do this buy \"extracting\" resources out of dangerous PvP centric lobbies that can in turn be crafted into better guns, gadgets, and ammo etc...\nHere's the reason why it's gamings new Mario 64 moment...\nThe top 10 best selling Atari (console) games are Pacman, Space Invaders, Asteroids, Missile Command, Donkey Kong, River Raid, Adventure, Combat, Football, and Pitfall. 10/10 of those games are session based games. Each session is relatively short, and plays nearly identical to the last. The only \"progression\" we see is from the players skill level improving.\nThe top 10 best selling NES (console) games are Mario 3, Mario 2, Zelda, Tetris, Metroid, Punch Out, Final Fantasy, The Adventure of Link, Castlevania, and Kirby's Adventure. Only 6/10 of those game are session based games. Zelda, Final Fantasy, The Adventures of Link, and Kirby's Adventure have a save system that allowed for a longer gameplay narrative.\nThe top 10 best selling PlayStation games are Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo 2, FF VII, GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, FF VIII, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Crash Bandicoot 2. Only 1/10 of those games are session based games - Tekken 3. The trend is clear. We prefer long form narrative to session based games. Today, it's unheard of for a session based game to sell more than 10 million copies.\nHere's the top 10 most popular multiplayer games of today...\nFortnite - Session based. Roblox - Session based. CSGO - Session based. League of Legends - Session based. Valorant - Session based. Dota 2 - Session based. Warzone - Session based. PUBG - Session based. World of Warcraft - Long form FF XIV - Long form\nMultiplayer is in the transition period we saw between early 1980s Atari and the mid 1990s PlayStation. It took about 15 years to shift from mostly session based single player games to mostly long form single player games.\nThe Extraction Shooter genre is the best positioned to take us into the new era of multiplayer for two reasons. First, how many PvP genres lend themselves to long form narrative? The Extraction genre and the Survival genre? The industry seems to be pouring significantly more resources into making Extraction Shooters at the moment (ARC Raiders, PUBG Black Budget, Marathon, Exoborne, Far Cry Extraction, Warzone DMZ 2.0 etc...). Secondly, the genre is ripe for popularity growth because the objective is not to kill opposing players. The objective is to extract. This means that people who are interested in collecting, puzzle solving, exploring, socializing, and building are more likely to find their place in the genre. Bungies Marathon seems best suited to take the genre forward because of their production value advantage as well as the fact that they're targeting different types of players by making unique character classes. Thief and Stealth for example, aren't likely to be frontline CoD esque run and gun character classes.\nWhat say you? Marathon is videogames next Mario 64 moment?\nOpen comment sort options\nIt will never be the next big thing as long as Tarkies are running things. They leave no room for casuals or experimenting. Which is why the overall player base has stagnated.\nARC Raiders is for \"Tarkies\". It's for the masses.\nNot based on this sub. You would think this is strictly a pvp game with no pve experiences at all and no group activities.\ni loved the tech test because it was pvp with occasional grouping and risky grouping. that led to some fun and unique experiences. but the way people on this sub talk. they plan on just killing each other, which imo ruins what made this game feel unique.\nImagine not mentioning Tarkov\nI didn't mention any game in the genre because my focus was on the framework, not specific titles.\nWhat exactly does qualify as \"session based\"? I start the game, play a while and turn it off again?\nWhat about the best selling games of all time? Minecraft, GTA V, Ark: Survival Evolved, The Sims, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2....\nHell no, it doesn't to anything unique or groundbreaking to justify that. It doesn't even try to be innovative\nA \"session based\" game is one where the full loop ends in a single sitting.\nAn 8 minute Call of Duty match. A 20 minute Fortnite match. A 12 minute Gran Turismo 7 race.\nThe Extraction genre stretches out the full loop into something that resembles and RPG like Skyrim or Pokemon\nOne reason those games are so popular is that they are session-based. Everyone is on an even playing field when a session starts. Now, removing both of these aspects isn't going to make your game more popular, that's for sure. That's why I don't see extraction games as becoming the next big thing in gaming.\nLol no.... I'd say extractions are on their last leg and almost out,  I'd say battle royals are cooked, I'm expecting a new genre.\nVery interesting to hear someone think the genre is on it's last legs before the AAA wave of Extraction Shooters even begins lol\nNext two years will make your head spin.\nNaughty Dog tried it with TLOU Factions and got to a point that this kind of genre needs a high amount of service in the background and besides that none of the studios that had released an extrShooter has gotten THE formula to make everyone Happy, just look at Tarkov its in early access for nearly a DECADE now (8. years) and its still in finetuning.\nits really not that easy to handle the economy right to please active players and making it easy for new players to join a game without getting stumped by high tier players. theirs a few where it shines to look good... (Eft, Hunt, TCF, DnD and Insurgency S.) lets see whats happen after Arc is getting a second banger on consoles... yeah it could be a kick for ES games\nHunt: Showdown, AAA studio. Rainbow Six: Extraction, also AAA studio. CoD: Warzone DMZ also AAA studio. I'd say the AAA wave already started (and in some cases fizzled).\nAs someone who is playing Hunt Showdown for over 5 years now I am amused when people experienced the genre with Arc for the first time and are feeling that this is something new.\nThe genre is over a century old the problem is that all big companies fucked up big time in copying this genre. The biggest fault you can make is, to make it too casual. This genre HAS to be punishing. You need the fear of loosing something.\nHazard Zone was DOA and DMZ is a soulless shitshow compared to Tarkov or Hunt for example.\nSo it was about time that this genre gets another big hit. That this game is 3rd person will make it special, compared to the other great extraction shooters.\nNo offense to Hunt Showdown player but Hunt is barely an Extraction Shooter. It's almost a Battle Royale.\nEscape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders exemplify the genres potential significantly more than Hunt for a multitude of reasons.\ni think these extraction shooters still pretty heavily reseble session based games. you are not living in that world, you just take part in these scavenging sessions to level up your character. i think sandbox style games like rust is where we see the next big thing.\nI can guarantee there were a number of market analysts who said Extraction Shooters are the next big thing some years ago. That's why we're starting to see more, now that dev cycles are finishing.\nDifference is that AAA developers are now getting their first Extraction Shooters out today. The genre has been relegated to indie developers who lack funding up to this point\nI think extraction shooters benefit from lacking one thing that most modern shooters have, skill based matchmaking. Not having skill based matchmaking already makes the game feel a lot better to play because you actually feel rewarded for getting better.\nFortnite was fun when it first came out but due to the introduction of SBMM it became a sweatfest and it got old. Same with CoD, we all loved the old CoD's which coincidently had no SBMM.\nActually, SBMM has been studied extensively in the industry. It's only included to help the player base to have more fun matches.\nThose against it are the types who want to play basketball as an able bodied person against women's wheelchair players.\nIf you find crushing inferior opponents fun, you're a weirdo lol\nSince there is waaayyy much action and fear to loose, the thrill will be the next dopamin hook for a lot of people. They allways greed for fear and action, this is the Best way currently\nIm not read your essay but I think arc raiders will change the entire genre. Current state of genre really excited and people want to try bu most of games are not well polished or balanced even eft\nFortnite: Free to play, Roblox: Free to play, CSGO: Free to play, League of Legends: Free to play, Valorant: Free to Play, DOTA2: Free to play, Warzone: Free to play, PUBG: Free to play...\nYour answer might be more the cost of entry than they are session based games.\nnot rly .. they all make the same stupid mistakes, if its extraction looter than make that the core gameplay.\nreality is most add some marked etc, than its just some arena shooter with extra steps cause everyone just buys BIS instead of self found items .\nlooking at tarkov, dark n darker .. they all made this stupid mistake and are no more fun to me.\nnot having clearly defined session goals beyond extracting means a session can feel like a win just for experiencing some crazy shit and a few close gunfights without dying\ni want embark to lean more into player choice and consequences\nadd reputation system > (speranza or exiles)\nmaybe youre blood thirsty. you just want the best weps and gear to pvp. but this bloodthirst means speranza hates you (for killing in range of elevators) and wont let you come back, so you cant use their trading services with players. now you have to live in \"exile\" camps. nobody brings you back when you die in raid, youre either broke nearly dead in your solo shack starting a raid again or do the after-death PvE re-gearing missions like the tutorial\nmaybe youre a horder , or a trader. not using the best gear but instead limiting yourself to cheap loadouts for max gain and minimal loss, and selling or trading gear to other people\nmaybe you could focus on creating/sourcing excess medical supplies that donating to speranza would give you experience boosts and temporarily bring the supply costs down for players to buy from traders\nmaybe youre weird, and just wanna get into gunfights with people then defibb them to see if theyll fight with you after\nemote options for squads to temporarily reveal positions or overhead names to each other if you link up in game\nThe genre has a lot of potential...but it probably won't be reached.\nExtractions shooters(ES), the ones chock full of all the new stuff people want, are resource hungry beasts that need a lot of time and work to develop. With indie ES like \"Hell is Others\", \"Zero Sievert\", or \"No Escape from Madness\" really pull back on the number of features specifically because they just can't match what big budget publishers can pump into a title, and rather focus on some core mechanics their developers liked. Usually a PvE-focused aspect.\nDoes this mean look to big publishers to make something good? Nope. A lot of them are very risk averse, and would rather just copy each other's formula when making their own ES with one or two tweaks to make theirs look more interesting, all to trap players in a dopamine drip to keep coming back.\ntl:dr the teams that can make a real difference lack the resources to do it, and the teams that do are subservient to managers who barely understand games and don't want to take a gamble on innovative ideas. ARC Raiders is a lightning in a bottle situation that is pushing the boundaries just enough that their publishers aren't getting cold feet but still innovative enough to stand out from previous titles. There's still a lot of room to grow though; and I honestly don't know if we'll see it before the big publishing companies move on to the next big thing.\nReddit, Inc. © 2025.
