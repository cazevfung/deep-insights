    "content": "Well everyone, today we're trying something a little different. We are trying Arena Breakout Infinite, which just launched on Steam and is a freeto-play hardcore tactical extraction shooter that you should play without uh being distracted with uh doing a video intro. That's a bad idea. Spin move. Spin move. Running. Okay. Okay. Just lesson learned. Okay. I shouldn't I shouldn't record intros while we're while we're doing stuff. It's a bad idea. Bad idea. I'm going to get jumped. Now, I've actually played a lot of Extraction Shooters in the last year or so. So, when the devs over at More Fun Studios, the guys behind Arena Breakout Infinite, offered me the chance to try the game and share it with you in a video, I said, \"Sure, as long as I'm allowed to say whatever I want to say.\" And they said, \"Absolutely. Say whatever you want to say. We just want you to play the game and share it with your audience.\" And that's what we're doing today. So, thank you to More Fun Studios and Arena Breakout Infinite for sponsoring the video. But rest assured, I'm going to tell you what I think. And it just so happens that I am pretty impressed. Now, I've actually been playing it for a few days, and there's a bunch of little bitty quality of life things that are really important in an extraction shooter, in my opinion, that they get right here. For one, it's free to play, meaning that you can just load in and try it for yourself to see if it's your type of game and if it feels good to you, which is important because this type of game is not for everybody. And if you want to play with your buddies or at least get them introduced to the genre or to this specific game now, they can just easily get into it. But even if you want to play it solo, there are solo modes, duos modes, and of course the kind of core trios mode, which the game is mostly built around. There's all sorts of little touches. Like for example, if I want to check how many rounds I have in my magazine, you'll notice it's not on the UI like on screen. But if I just go alt t, you actually check the magazine by hand. You can actually like physically check it. If I swap to my shotgun and check that way, you can see, okay, I've got about half left. Okay, so maybe this would be a time to reload if I had ammunition. And once you start reloading, it plays out in real time. And so you can't just play willy-nilly. You know, this is not like a light-hearted Call of Duty type shooter. This is much more hardcore and tactical, even down to something as small in detail as the ability to sway and lean around corners to peak it. Now, they have five different maps right now available for you to try. And they have different playlists and loadouts available for missions with all different modes, for highle play, for introductory play. So, there's all sorts of different ways for you to sink your teeth into it, whether you're a new player or a very experienced one. And I will say the sound design is really good, and you'll find yourself listening very carefully. You hear that? You might need headphones, but you can hear the shots in the distance, and it's from behind the metal, so I know that there's a team in there looting it. So, I could I could set up camp here and just wait to snipe them if I wanted to to be a bit of a troll. Uh oh, my buddy's getting jumped. Uh yeah, I really I really need to be better about filming these videos with teammates. I feel so bad cuz I'll like go off and I'm filming something, I'm talking and rambling, and then my buddy gets jumped and uh that's just what happens. Oh, he's done. I'm sorry, dude. I'm so sorry. I am purely to blame now because this is a hardcore tactical extraction shooter. My teammate's just done. He's just dead and his stuff is gone. And that's sad for him. Again, I am to blame. This is my fault. But uh there's not much I can do about it now. You know, there's not a lot of, you know, quick res or anything. That's not really how this game works. You might also notice, for example, that I have that little orange minus uh ear icon in the bottom left. And that's actually an indication based on my load out. I'm wearing a helmet that actually suppresses sound. So, I can't hear cues as clearly as if I weren't wearing a helmet. They actually adjust the audio and uh audio balancing based on the equipment you have on, which is super super cool. Certain helmets, for example, have a visor that will literally limit your field of view. It's just really really carefully thought out and well executed if you ask me. Now, like I mentioned, there's a bunch of different maps and game modes for you to try out. I've played in multiple. My personal favorite is probably the TV station. Because it's a TV station, there's a bunch of different small vignettes built as sets throughout the station, and it creates for some really fun encounters where each individual encounter can take place in a totally different micro setting. It's It's very interesting and cool. Not to mention the tight corridors make it really, really intense when you're trying to hunt down other teams and take their loot. It's just really well executed in my opinion. It's big enough for you to get lost in and to find a bunch of new interesting stuff, but it's also intimate and tight enough in the important areas that you don't feel as though players can just run away from you and escape when you get to jump on them. They also have a limited time storm event going on right now where they take the farm map and add a ton of extra challenging things to it such as intense rain, a bunch of wind, heavy fog, reduced visibility, and the rain makes it louder so you can't hear enemies coming. It just takes all the knobs and turns them up to 11. It is much more intense. Another aspect of the game that I think is so so important in an extraction shooter or really any hardcore any type of game is that it needs to feel fair. Like it needs to feel as though when you died it's because you did something wrong or your team screwed up. Like it shouldn't feel as though the game just misbehaved. And I will give them credit. They've done a really really good job of tightening this up. Like I said, the game existed before it launched on Steam, but now that it's on Steam, a whole new wave of players are finding it, and it is just really well put together. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the movement to the inventory system and the actual builds of weapons and armor sets and everything. It's just all so robust and sturdy and well put together that it makes it feel like if somebody got to jump on you, it's your own fault. You weren't listening close enough. you weren't paying attention or you know you were recording the intro for a YouTube video while your buddy was alone off in the distance. Oh, like right here. I just heard a dude walking around. Okay, so there's a guard there. There are going to be some NPC guards on patrol, but then there's also players that will of course be exploring as you are doing your thing. And you just never really know. You can usually tell like visually they'll be wearing different outfits and loadouts, but but sometimes you just got to be cautious. I just heard somebody. That's a regular guard. He's just doing his thing. This game makes you so paranoid. I swear it's it's kind of awesome because I mean it's a tactical extraction shooter. You should play it very cautiously and not be playing like crazy. But, you know, I guess it's just proof that the game's working. It's making me act all crazy and hyper paranoid. Now, personally, I think my favorite part of the game that I've encountered so far is actually the weapon building, assembly, and modification system within the gunsmith. This is basically a system you can use when you're building out your loadout to go into a match. And it allows you to either build guns using attachments you already have, or you can buy them from an in-game store where other players can sell items they've collected, or you can buy them from a merchant that the developers have basically built out for you, though that's for a higher price typically. And there is a ton of customization, whether it's the barrel that you use, the specific rail you attach your scope to, the scopes of course, suppressors, compensators, muzzles, chokes, you name it, they've got it. and it allows you to build exactly the kind of gun that you want um for your play style, which again I appreciate. I tend to be kind of slow and steady, scout heavy, snipe heavy. Like that's just how I tend to play all sorts of games, but that's just me. Other people are going to be much more run and gun probably running in with SMGs and shotguns and stuff, and that's totally fine. In which case, you can build it out the way you want. Oh my god. Oh my god. These are all just the NPCs, so they're like not that dangerous, but they are just annoying enough for you to need to pay attention. He's wearing a helmet, so I don't think that domed him. Oh my god. Come on, Pika. There we go. Okay, not my proudest moment. I missed a few of those. Now, I was trying to come up with things that I had like frustrations over. Ooh, a hydraulic wrench for 65,000. That's nice. I was trying to like come up with the the points of frustration that I have with the game if there are any. And honestly, I don't really have any firm notes. Like I think it's a really wellexecuted extraction shooter and they've done a really good job. They've even directly responded to people's frustrations over like potential payto-in aspects of a game like this, which is crucial in a free-to-play game that it's not just pay to win, which is something that you can sometimes end up with in games like this. So, in response for this update, they actually removed the ability to buy the in-game currency you use to purchase gun attachments and stuff, meaning now it's just cosmetics only, which again, I think is really, really good, really healthy for the long-term life cycle of the game because it now means again when I go into an encounter, if I get jumped and get outplayed, it's because the other player just had better equipment or or was a better player probably realistically. And it was not because they just spent more money. It was because they knew what they were doing. And I'll be honest, so far that's been my experience in the game when I encounter other players. It's usually because they were posted up tactically and they were watching for me. They listened closer than I was. I wasn't paying full attention to the environment and I could have seen some indication that they had been there, like an open door, but I just wasn't thinking about it. And that's exactly what you would hope to see in a tactical extraction shooter. things that are fair, balanced, and that you could have picked up on if you had been paying more attention. One of the other things I commonly have to bring up with extraction shooters is the ability to play solo because these games can often be so dependent on other players filling out your team that one bad matchup can ruin your entire evening of playing games. Like if you grind out for hours collecting all this amazing loot and then you get matched with one random set of teammates that just are terrible, it can ruin your entire time with the game because they get you killed and you lose all of your stuff. And so having a solo queue can be really really nice because it means that you can just get in there, play by yourself. You don't have to worry about anybody else affecting it. It is just you and other solo players. And that for me is wonderful, especially if the game is balanced in a way where that can still be fun. That really makes a difference for me uh and the type of player that I am. And like I said, they have solo cues, they have duos as well in this game. And because it is free to play, you can just ask your buddies if they want to hop on with you, play around or two, and you can do that because there's no barrier to entry. You just download it and do it that way. You'll notice when I pull up the map, there's actually numerous extraction sites and different like points of interest on this one map. Like I said, there's five maps for you to choose from when you go into a match. But like this one, in order to unlock it, I have to search any five unarched weapon cases as a team to extract. This one, the canal gate is closed. Find the switch in the second floor of the control room to open it. This one though is active after 15 minutes of the raid. This one is a secret patch passage open 15 minutes after the raid starts. So you can pick which one you want and then go on from there. I will mention that my experience so far with other players and random matched teams in the game has actually been quite positive. They've been supportive and helpful and when we went into voice chat, they were actually helping me understand the game and learn some of the tips and tricks. And it was quite refreshing honestly to play a hardcore game where the community was just supportive and nice and kind and excited to have new players in the lobby and server with them which is not an experience I've had in a lot of other hardcore games. So it was nice to see cuz the community is not something you can like market into a game. It's not something you can force. It's just something that happens emergently. Like if the community is is chill that's awesome because you cannot fake it. You can't buy a good community. It just is what it is. And amazingly enough, they have a really, really seemingly kind and supportive community in this game, which is not something I can say about every game I've tried. So, props to whoever is responsible for that. I mean, maybe it's just luck of the draw or whatever, but ultimately, I guess it's the community themselves that should be should be uh thanked and proud of it cuz they're the ones doing it. But they've done a great job and honestly, it's so refreshing to see it. Oh, yeah. They were totally here. See, they're searching all of this. They dumped some other stuff they didn't need and then they extracted 1,000%. Okay. Well, I think that means I'm alone now. I think I think I'm solo. Well, in that case, we're good to extract. So, I'm just going to go stand in the extract zone for 10 seconds and then get out. I didn't collect a whole lot of stuff, but you know, we we proved the point that even a dude like me can extract. They also have a really cool like recap system in the game. So you can see everywhere you traveled and ran and where you didn't go. So next match maybe I go over to the armory and I search there because that's kind of like the main thing on this map. You can see a different timestamps when you either found a a unique piece of uh loot or maybe you went in and you found a a specific enemy and eliminated them. Like it's just a cool recap. I like that. But then after the match we're good to go in again. We just hit enter and we can choose which mode we want. normal lockdown which is like the next tier above that forbidden zone which is much higher tier. It's the extreme danger and just to play this mode you basically select which map you want to do and then you see there is a minimum value 300,000 and a 50,000 buyin. So it's not something you're just going to casually do when you first start playing. This is more endgame stuff. Similarly, they also have the solo ops mode which you can select there and then choose whichever map is currently available for it. It also has a minimum value as well to make it worth it for the other players if they happen to jump you. But once you select the map that you want, you select that. And let's say we're going to go Northridge. Let's select that. And then we're going to prepare our load out. And as you can see here, like I wanted more magazines for my rifle. So I just unload it. I have it here in my inventory. And these are those little like quality of life improvements. You just rightclick, you can search for it, and then you can find it available for sale. from other players or the marketplace more generally. And then you can just buy them if you need them using the in-game currency you've collected by selling other things you've collected. And then I have plenty of these uh magazines available to me. You can see when you highlight stuff, it also highlights the ammunition for that weapon and the magazines. So I can just like drag in a couple more of these if I want to have even more. I just drag on top of them the ammunition to load them up. I can also like just leave that in there. I drop the the mag into the rifle. Boom. I have it. Easy peasy. Lemon squeezy. I want more of this ammo. I can either transfer it from my inventory if I already have it, which in this case I do. I've got plenty. So, I can do that. And uh I'm I'm good to go. And then we load in, we pay our fee, and we start matchmaking to get in there. Again, it's all these little quality of life improvements and things that have not been in some of the extraction shooters I've tried this year. Let's just say that. Not calling anybody out, but you would hope to see some of this little bitty stuff that just makes it easier to get in and actually play the game and to just quickly do things like managing your inventory or your weapons or ammunition. I just love to see those things added here in a free-to-play game as well. It's just again really nice. And voila, we are in ready to go. You can select your POIs like if I want to get to Oh no. Oh no. So that that's what I get. That's what I get. You know, these these types of games can be difficult to film videos in because like you load in, it's like, okay, we're there. You pop in, you open the map to select where you're going, and boom, somebody spotted you and you're dead. Like 58 seconds is how long I technically was in the match while I was loading in and getting set up. At least, you know, it seems like it was a hardcore player that does this a lot. OP eliminations, total damage dealt, 400k, total value, 853 million. This is somebody who who has played a lot, so they know what they're doing. They were they might have been camping the spawn. You never know. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see him get me. As I'm like standing there opening the map, you can see. Okay, let's get in the game, guys. I'm really excited. He's like, what is this loser doing? And then I'm trying to frantically close the map and then Oh, well. Yeah, that's kind of my fault. Well played. What a way to end it. Thank you again to More Fun Games for sponsoring the video, giving me the chance to check it out. I'm actually having a really, really good time. And again, I can't say that about every extraction shooter I've played this year. um that got quite old quite quick. And this one has a lot more content, a lot more quality of life improvements, which are also really good to see. And um when you die, you also get a clean recap of exactly what they used on you, what weapons they used, what ammo they used, where the bullets hit, and everything, which is honestly kind of cool. Um I died because of the hit to the head. And uh there we go. There you go. But of course, if you want to check out the game yourself, it'll be linked in the description box below. And like I said, it's free to play, so you can just download it on Steam, check it out, see if it's up your alley, and give it a shot. But with all that said, thank you for watching. I love you all desperately, and I'll see you in the next video. Hugs and kisses. Bye-bye.",

    "content": "Apparently, consumer interest in extraction shooters ranks among the lowest. So, why do developers keep making them? Let's talk about it. So, there's a lot of chat about extraction shooters lately. Obviously, we have all the stuff happening with Marathon. Maybe not good stuff happening with Marathon, but we've also got excessive arc raiders. They just had the service land last weekend. And then the other day, Matt Piscatella, who works at Sakana, what's he up to now? What's he saying? He posted on Blue Sky, \"What's funny is that overall consumer interest in extraction shooters rates among the lowest across genres. And yet, why are devs so infatuated with this particular space? It's baffling. Is it a game maker's favorite kind of game?\" That is very surprising. I thought extraction shooters would be pretty high in terms of interest. If extraction shooters are a game maker's favorite kind of game in the same way that immersive sims are a game journalist's favorite kind of game. Oh yeah, that's a good way to look at it. Dishonored enjoyers are here. We had uh Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins came into the studio to talk a little bit about why people are making Yeah. I mean came in to talk about Arc, but then we were like, why do people keep making this? And he was like, first of all, relax. Second of all, let me explain to you why. So, we'll kick off with this quote from him cuz we asked about why Embark, you know, released the finals, working on the finals, also decided to get into the extraction shooter space. And uh turns out it was all thanks to a little pivot. Take it away, Virgil. The main factor that led to the pivot itself was the fact that we just couldn't get a game mode together that was repeatably fun. We had a lot of very interesting tech going into our enemies and like amazing art and and world building going into it, but the way the sessions were structured, you'd have fun maybe one out of 10 times. You knew you had to go kill a giant robot and that was cool, but there was nothing for you to do in between. So he tried more structured things like a mode where you went into an area and did objectives and then the giant boss would arrive or a mode where you were defending one of the outposts and it was kind of like a wave-based thing. And those were better, provided more structure, but again it lacked um a reason for you to ever repeat that because most of the the game lacked any sort of meta to it. You didn't have what we have today where you go back home and craft or do things or expand your your way of play. So, we just kept coming back to the fact that while it offered a novel experience, there was nothing to keep you coming back to it. You'd go, \"That was fun, but why?\" We had just done like a test, a public test, limited at the time. And saw the results from that and and the direction group at the time kind of went away and we had our big summer party and we're celebrating a good test and come back and they're like, \"Well, we're changing everything.\" Um, but it it honestly was for the better. Like I think a lot of us were unsure or or even skeptical of how we would ship what that game was trying to be. And certainly for us being such a small team relative to the amount of content that type of game implies, it really wasn't a good prospect for us to to make enough stuff that players would keep playing for that many hours. I think it really just made sense to move forward with the plans for PvE as a thing and then start shaping our game around that and then the meta that comes with it. So, how could we take the tension and the risk and the stories that come out of extraction games and put that into the world we've created and utilize all the learnings and PVE elements that we had to to make that into something from the outside looking in when I think about extraction shooters is something like a talk of doesn't feel very approachable to me and I feel like marathon certainly yes this is more approachable to me maybe in terms of the ease at which I guess you would kind of get in and like it didn't seem as daunting dealing with this this this and And so we talked to Virgil because you are not only competing with other games, you're competing against people's time. And so you want to make that on-ramp as easy as possible. So here's what he had to say about approachability. Very early it was trying to figure out in the metagame layer how we could kind of sand off some of those rough edges. You get in situations where you've lost a few rounds and now you have nothing left. and we wanted to just offer a a kit of gear to people straight away. So, we have a free load out that you can take at any time. There's no strings attached, but it's pretty limited in its capability. We still wanted you to have a minimally viable way to always play the game as intended. And then we also added kind of what we just call safety nets. So, one you might be familiar with is the the rooster that gives you materials to provide economic safety net for players. If you're not succeeding a lot, we still wanted you to progress incrementally and have a few materials on hand so you could craft like the gun you want to use or a piece of like gear or something like that. And then on top of that, it was adding a lot of ways to progress without succeeding. Do a quest, get some XP, finish a challenge, something. So these things carry with you even if you don't extract at the end of a round. I think the thing that really happens with extraction shooters is there's the story part of it. There is the starting hopefully ending with taking a big sack full of loot, you know, escaping by the skin of your teeth. The stories that we would play, like we're playing Overwatch or Call of Duty would be the stories of crap that we would say as friends, like fun bits. It would never be a specific moment in a game really. Whereas in Inraction shooters, it's like, \"Oh, do you remember when I got downed and then this and then I had this and you know, leaving that kind of thing.\" the kind of metrics that you use to judge whether you're having fun or being successful feel way more varied, diverse, and a little more forgiving on the extraction shooter side compared to battle royals and standard multiplayer games as well. You know, your kill death ratio, how you're contributing, but in an extraction shooter, it could be as simple as I didn't kill anyone, but I managed to get out with a new weapon. Yeah. So, it's not as contingent on you being super sharp with a mouse or a keyboard or or your controller and nailing head shot, which I think means, as you said, the barrier to entry and approachability is much better. So, you can do a bunch of different things. It's the same way that when we played Overwatch, it was like sometimes when you weren't having a great uh kind of session, you'd be like, I'm going to heal and I will be in the back holding M1 skillfree. Exactly. That means that even if you're not performing super well, you have a story to tell. you have you're contributing in a way that is still significant and I think that's something that extraction shooters get really really right even amongst the complexities of an extraction shooter design economy etc etc so arc raiders is out next week and it is very strange seeing the story of Arc Raiders versus the story of Marathon I don't want to certainly be kicking them while they're down want games to succeed here we actually spoke to Virgil a little bit not to you know dig or anything but to get his perspective on that comparison that's being made Like obviously there are a lot more extraction shooters. It's a much more invogue game mode. Yeah. But we were interested. It's like what's it like to watch when everything's going right for you but not necessarily going right someone else or someone else. I mean any outside information and that we can get is always great. So if if someone else can take a leap and maybe not succeed at it or or do and then have to reshape some other elements around it. I think that's good information to have. It was interesting during our tech test two to have them, you know, alongside us there and and kind of it was a very good sort of AB test almost of like things that we had opted not to do or had opted to do and how that kind of shook out. So certainly it's um good for contrast. I suppose the thing that I wrote about in my preview and we talked about is the game overall marathon. It didn't feel like it had something new to provide in the genre. And in the extraction shooter world, it's something that players can pick up on way more acutely than pretty much any other genre. And that's something I definitely picked up when I was playing it. I was like, \"Okay, this is a game that feels like it's ticking the extraction shoot boxes, but it doesn't understand or aspire to create the kind of magic that keeps that all that stuff together.\" for a game like Ark and for Marathon, they're also trying to convince people that all the time and money and, you know, effort they've invested in an existing extraction shooter should be left behind for a new one. And that is a tricky thing to do because you need a real unique idea. You need a hook of your own, but also you can't stray too far from what that core experience is, which is really, really tricky. And that is something we asked Virgil about. How do you strike that balance? and you know what is the key challenge for a new extraction shooter that you're facing and you know what Marathon is facing and no doubt what other extraction shooters will face. We've gone through internal iterations where we've had mechanics and then remove them even if the mechanic itself was pretty solid or fun. It did not make sense in the context of the whole game as I mentioned with things like uh our safety nets in the game. So free loadouts and and stuff. Other games have um like insurance systems for example to get some of your gear back and we tried stuff like that. It just really didn't seem to fit or it would have had to be been shoehorned in so much that we just kind of went for an alternate approach that ideally at the end achieves the same result but works inside of what our ecosystem is. So why do you think developers are so infatuated with extraction shoes? Do you think it's a boardroom decision? They see the success of things like hunt and tarov and are like hey we want to get into that. So Evan from PC Gamer replied to Matt's uh kind of statement. Extraction shooters are an evolution of an evolution and that's where a lot of like novel interesting new ideas stand and I think when you look at it from that perspective it can read as developers are interested in it because it does have that space within where you can be novel and create new ideas. You can have moments within moments. Yeah. The problem is you with meta progression on top of those moments. Exactly. If it's a evolution of evolution and the original starting point is something that you know is a success that being a first person shooter, you know that you're on a pathway which if you can get enough right, you have an inbuilt interesting audience already because people play shooters, you know. All right, thank you for watching another episode of Spoton. We'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Uh, in the meantime, you can find us here on GameSpot or Tam, you're at I'm tomorh.com on Blue Sky and to H everywhere else. I'm Lucy James Games everywhere. So, we will see you in a couple weeks. Thanks for watching. Bye. Apparently, consumer interest in extraction shooters ranks among the lowest. So, why do developers keep making them? Let's talk about it.

I mean came in to talk about Arc, but then we were like, why do people keep making this? And he was like, first of all, relax. Second of all, let me explain to you why. So, we'll kick off with this quote from him cuz we asked about why Embark, you know, released the finals, working on the finals, also decided to get into the extraction shooter space. And uh turns out it was all thanks to a little pivot. Take it away, Virgil. The main factor that led to the pivot itself was the fact that we just couldn't get a game mode together that was repeatably fun. We had a lot of very interesting tech going into our enemies and like amazing art and and world building going into it, but the way the sessions were structured, you'd have fun maybe one out of 10 times. You knew you had to go kill a giant robot and that was cool, but there was nothing for you to do in between. So he tried more structured things like a mode where you went into an area and did objectives and then the giant boss would arrive or a mode where you were defending one of the outposts and it was kind of like a wave-based thing. And those were better, provided more structure, but again it lacked um a reason for you to ever repeat that because most of the the game lacked any sort of meta to it. You didn't have what we have today where you go back home and craft or do things or expand your your way of play. So, we just kept coming back to the fact that while it offered a novel experience, there was nothing to keep you coming back to it. You'd go, \"That was fun, but why?\" We had just done like a test, a public test, limited at the time. And saw the results from that and and the direction group at the time kind of went away and we had our big summer party and we're celebrating a good test and come back and they're like, \"Well, we're changing everything.\" Um, but it it honestly was for the better. Like I think a lot of us were unsure or or even skeptical of how we would ship what that game was trying to be. And certainly for us being such a small team relative to the amount of content that type of game implies, it really wasn't a good prospect for us to to make enough stuff that players would keep playing for that many hours. I think it really just made sense to move forward with the plans for PvE as a thing and then start shaping our game around that and then the meta that comes with it. So, how could we take the tension and the risk and the stories that come out of extraction games and put that into the world we've created and utilize all the learnings and PVE elements that we had to to make that into something from the outside looking in when I think about extraction shooters is something like a talk of doesn't feel very approachable to me and I feel like marathon certainly yes this is more approachable to me maybe in terms of the ease at which I guess you would kind of get in and like it didn't seem as daunting dealing with this this this and And so we talked to Virgil because you are not only competing with other games, you're competing against people's time. And so you want to make that on-ramp as easy as possible. So here's what he had to say about approachability. Very early it was trying to figure out in the metagame layer how we could kind of sand off some of those rough edges. You get in situations where you've lost a few rounds and now you have nothing left. and we wanted to just offer a a kit of gear to people straight away. So, we have a free load out that you can take at any time. There's no strings attached, but it's pretty limited in its capability. We still wanted you to have a minimally viable way to always play the game as intended. And then we also added kind of what we just call safety nets. So, one you might be familiar with is the the rooster that gives you materials to provide economic safety net for players. If you're not succeeding a lot, we still wanted you to progress incrementally and have a few materials on hand so you could craft like the gun you want to use or a piece of like gear or something like that. And then on top of that, it was adding a lot of ways to progress without succeeding. Do a quest, get some XP, finish a challenge, something. So these things carry with you even if you don't extract at the end of a round. I think the thing that really happens with extraction shooters is there's the story part of it. There is the starting hopefully ending with taking a big sack full of loot, you know, escaping by the skin of your teeth. The stories that we would play, like we're playing Overwatch or Call of Duty would be the stories of crap that we would say as friends, like fun bits. It would never be a specific moment in a game really. Whereas in Inraction shooters, it's like, \"Oh, do you remember when I got downed and then this and then I had this and you know, leaving that kind of thing.\" the kind of metrics that you use to judge whether you're having fun or being successful feel way more varied, diverse, and a little more forgiving on the extraction shooter side compared to battle royals and standard multiplayer games as well. You know, your kill death ratio, how you're contributing, but in an extraction shooter, it could be as simple as I didn't kill anyone, but I managed to get out with a new weapon. Yeah. So, it's not as contingent on you being super sharp with a mouse or a keyboard or or your controller and nailing head shot, which I think means, as you said, the barrier to entry and approachability is much better. So, you can do a bunch of different things. It's the same way that when we played Overwatch, it was like sometimes when you weren't having a great uh kind of session, you'd be like, I'm going to heal and I will be in the back holding M1 skillfree. Exactly. That means that even if you're not performing super well, you have a story to tell. you have you're contributing in a way that is still significant and I think that's something that extraction shooters get really really right even amongst the complexities of an extraction shooter design economy etc etc so arc raiders is out next week and it is very strange seeing the story of Arc Raiders versus the story of Marathon I don't want to certainly be kicking them while they're down want games to succeed here we actually spoke to Virgil a little bit not to you know dig or anything but to get his perspective on that comparison that's being made Like obviously there are a lot more extraction shooters. It's a much more invogue game mode. Yeah. But we were interested. It's like what's it like to watch when everything's going right for you but not necessarily going right someone else or someone else. I mean any outside information and that we can get is always great. So if if someone else can take a leap and maybe not succeed at it or or do and then have to reshape some other elements around it. I think that's good information to have. It was interesting during our tech test two to have them, you know, alongside us there and and kind of it was a very good sort of AB test almost of like things that we had opted not to do or had opted to do and how that kind of shook out. So certainly it's um good for contrast. I suppose the thing that I wrote about in my preview and we talked about is the game overall marathon. It didn't feel like it had something new to provide in the genre. And in the extraction shooter world, it's something that players can pick up on way more acutely than pretty much any other genre. And that's something I definitely picked up when I was playing it. I was like, \"Okay, this is a game that feels like it's ticking the extraction shoot boxes, but it doesn't understand or aspire to create the kind of magic that keeps that all that stuff together.\" for a game like Ark and for Marathon, they're also trying to convince people that all the time and money and, you know, effort they've invested in an existing extraction shooter should be left behind for a new one. And that is a tricky thing to do because you need a real unique idea. You need a hook of your own, but also you can't stray too far from what that core experience is, which is really, really tricky. And that is something we asked Virgil about. How do you strike that balance? and you know what is the key challenge for a new extraction shooter that you're facing and you know what Marathon is facing and no doubt what other extraction shooters will face. We've gone through internal iterations where we've had mechanics and then remove them even if the mechanic itself was pretty solid or fun. It did not make sense in the context of the whole game as I mentioned with things like uh our safety nets in the game. So free loadouts and and stuff. Other games have um like insurance systems for example to get some of your gear back and we tried stuff like that. It just really didn't seem to fit or it would have had to be been shoehorned in so much that we just kind of went for an alternate approach that ideally at the end achieves the same result but works inside of what our ecosystem is. So why do you think developers are so infatuated with extraction shoes? Do you think it's a boardroom decision? They see the success of things like hunt and tarov and are like hey we want to get into that. So Evan from PC Gamer replied to Matt's uh kind of statement. Extraction shooters are an evolution of an evolution and that's where a lot of like novel interesting new ideas stand and I think when you look at it from that perspective it can read as developers are interested in it because it does have that space within where you can be novel and create new ideas. You can have moments within moments. Yeah. The problem is you with meta progression on top of those moments. Exactly. If it's a evolution of evolution and the original starting point is something that you know is a success that being a first person shooter, you know that you're on a pathway which if you can get enough right, you have an inbuilt interesting audience already because people play shooters, you know. All right, thank you for watching another episode of Spoton. We'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Uh, in the meantime, you can find us here on GameSpot or Tam, you're at I'm tomorh.com on Blue Sky and to H everywhere else. I'm Lucy James Games everywhere. So, we will see you in a couple weeks.

    "content": "I tried six single player extraction shooters with one goal in mind. To find the most immersive and engaging experience you can enjoy on your own. And when I say single player, I'm talking you versus the game. No one else involved. No human friends nor human enemies. After each game, I'll rate it out of five stars. Starting with Escape from Tarov, the PVE zone. In July of 2024, Battlestate Games released the PvE zone. It's basically Tarov without humans as enemies. All opponents are replaced with AI. You could co-op with friends, but in our case, we're going completely solo. And with over 6,000 hours clocked into Tarov PvP myself, I was genuinely curious to experience if the PvE zone can provide the same immersive and engaging fun the base PVP mode brings. I had my doubts though, unsure of how challenging AI could be. But in my first raid ever in Tarov PvE, this happened. immediately humbled by AI less than 5 minutes into my first game. So, I came back for another one. This time with full respect of what my opponents can bring to the table. What? That was a dual PMC. What the What was going on, dude? That was a dual PMC and I got spotted and I'm stuck. I'm getting pushed by someone else. Oh, I got another guy to my right. I can't even see this. Okay, there's a guy to my left and guy to my right. Need to try to aggro this guy in the right. Oh, there he is. I'm not sure if that was a PMC or a Scav. The dual's pushing me. Oh my god. What? What is up with that duo? These these guys actually legit scare me. They are legit scaring me. Someone to my left as well. I'm stuck in this freaking spawn, dude. Someone's walking to my left. He's about to come out. Just walked past me. This is crazy. None of them are fighting, too. It's me against the world chat. Oh, shoot. They're just looking at me. They're looking at me. They're just looking at me. I think I dropped one. I can't see him behind the fence. Did I drop any of them? What am I doing here? Can I get out of here? There's no door. I don't remember. There's no door here, right? This is crazy. I'm pinched right out of spawn. I can barely see them through that fence. There's walking to my left and to my right and none of them none of them are fighting. Yeah, I do have nades. The thing is like I just got to get rid of them. If I nade them, they just they just displace, right? I didn't kill any of them. Oh, I got one. I got I see one dead body right there. Can't open that door right there. We heard movement to the left. Okay, it's a it's a bare PMC to my left. So, we got to be careful with that dude. I don't know where this guy is. So, we did drop one. The other PMC though is still alive. I have no idea where he is. So, I have cover to my left, which is good. We heard him. He's close, right? He's behind his SUV. Okay, so we have to get rid of the guy on the right. Guy to my left just holding me as well. I guess we could grenade this guy here. Oh my god, dude. I have no idea where that was from. Dude, what is going on here? Actual horror game, chat. Oh, he's right here. He's going to push. He's pushing my heal. He's pushing my heal. That guy's dead. I've never been stuck in this corner for so long in my whole Tarov life. Okay, so it seems like right side's clear. There's a PMC in the left side earlier who's holding me. I'm trying to figure out how I can maybe I can grenade this dude out of the way. I think I might have just grenaded myself. Yeah, it I hit the freaking top. So, a bunch of dead PMC. I do want to loot these guys. Man, I swear if I start looting, I'm going to get shot. I feel it. Do I leave this guy chat? He looks chill. Dealing with PV is no joke. Super fine. Super fine. I don't want his dog tag to be fair. We're super super chill. Very chill right now. What is this? PS rounds. Yeah. Yeah, it's PS. We drop this mag. As like a first timer in PvE, I'm still trying to gauge the AI and it's very scary gauging them right now, chat. I will not lie. This guy is juiced. He's high level 17. This guy is gaming. This guy doesn't He's He's no life in touch grass. Level 17 gamer. Okay, we're good. That leaves no lifing. 15 minutes in and I've moved 10 m. After successfully clearing my immediate area and looting every drop of gear, I finally made it out of my spawn. Got out of this basement area and into the surface level, hoping to safely make my way to a nearby office to grab a hard drive for a quest. My goal for each single player extraction shooter is to finish at least one quest before allowing myself to move on to the next game. So, I carefully cleared my corners, grabbed the quest key from a nearby dead scientist, slowly made my way up to the offices, unlocked the door, grabbed my quest item, and sweatily but safely made it to extract. That was pretty sweaty. I like that experience. That was cool. Tarov PvE exceeded my expectations. I was immersed and completely engaged. The only downside is it's pricey cuz you'll need to buy the base game at $50, then buy the PV expansion for another 20, making it a $70 investment, which can be a big ask. But for one of the best extraction shooter experiences you can get out there, it might be worth your hard-earned money. Four out of five stars. Sweaty but expensive. Next up, another tactical PVE only extraction shooter that again, like Tarov PvE, you can either play solo or with friends. This is Incursion Red River. I actually had the chance to play this nearly a year ago for another video, but at the time I wasn't a huge fan of PvE extraction shooters. So, I was pretty critical about this game. But as the genre continues to evolve, I've come to appreciate why PvE extraction shooters exist. Not everyone wants the stress of PvP or the frustration of dealing with cheaters, both of which have ruined the experience of PvP extraction shooters for many. With that in mind, I returned to this game with a fresh perspective, approaching this session with intention, ready to fully immerse myself in the world of Incursion Red River. And it wasn't hard to do that cuz this game is absolutely gorgeous. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it takes advantage of how much you can push the engine visually. All right, we got the 74M with a flashlight. We put a a B10M on this and a foregrip. I don't remember what for grip we put. Let's go single fire. Oh, I pressed BB. Seems to be holster. So that's semi x. I'm going to go semi for now. Let's uh sorry. Oh, reload night vision. Okay, I like this. This is pressing M actually brought this out. Mag check. Hold R. Emergency reload. Drops mag double R. Normal reload. Let's do a mag check. Just see how it looks. Okay, that's a mag check. Cool. Flashlight. Uh four is the is the map thing, right? There we go. Secure intel. So, I accepted a quest to secure a document and delivered to a marked dropbox on the other side of the map. With my objective clear, I set out on the hunt. The g the movement feels really good. It actually feels good. Especially like you know how like most of our games that are like Tarov are so freaking clunky, Tarov included, the movement can get clunky. This one feels pretty smooth. They didn't go for the uh mega clunky realism kind of thing. It's more of accessible feeling. I was prepared. Feels actually pretty good. But not probably behind that wall there. Okay, hold up. Hold up. I don't know where I am. I'm going to walk here. So, what I can imagine based on like the feel so far, dude, where was that voice? That dude sounded like he was above me. He's not above me. Is what I what I can imagine here is this is definitely a game that I feel you could just be immersive with your friends with. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm right. Going up here. The other's board, too. He must be up here, cuz he sounded like he was right above me earlier, but he's not. Sector clear. Moving the next sector. Taking fire. Need assistance. Probably not a head shot. Voice voice acting is pretty good. Can I jump here? Let's hug this red wall. Damn, the game looks really good. Okay. Uh, one thing I want to check. Let's go check how how magp packing works. Or is it instapac like um Oops. I keep pressing I. Okay. Currently instack, which is fine. Just wondering. It's like placeholder for now, I assume. Okay, let's loot. Hold F to loot. Ooh, that looks nice. A saw and painkillers. We take those. That aug looked pretty nice. Let's inspect. I to inspect. Let's go try this. Okay, I got to keep checking the map. I am just 100% lost right now. Okay, so you can see the other mark on the base. Okay, that's what I was looking for. There's a white box marker south of you at the map. Yeah, so this is this is the one we were looking at, right? Or are you talking about further south? So I'm looking for the other marker. Or is this the is this the only marker? Is there any other marker that I'm where I'm supposed to grab the thing? You can see the other mark on the base. Oh, dude. I did not see that. That was Okay, I get it now. I get it, dude. It was so camouflaged. It was pretty camouflaged, not going to lie. Okay. Well, there's a dude right there. Do I I don't think I want to shoot now. Um I'm like in a weird spot. I don't even have range. Security move. All right, dude. I'm going to hug that container. So, our objective is somewhere here. Wait, we saw the dude up here rather. So, let's not let's be careful of that. I hear footsteps next to me. I can't tell if he's actually here. Activity reported. Proceed with caution. Oh, take cover. Someone's close left here on the corner. I remember seeing someone up there. Was that the building with the stairs? the Oh my goodness. There's someone here. This AUG hits feels like it hits harder than my AK because the bullets are better slightly. Felt like earlier my AK was just they were just tanking my AK bullets. This has I think um a little more pen. [Music] Hold up. That guy didn't shoot me the whole time. Oh. [Music] He was hiding behind cover. You see his animation chat? He's hiding behind cover, but there was a window. But um yeah, cheat to that guy. One thing I'm um starting to like learn about these types of games is that um I always felt like every tactical shooter has to be very challenging to be fun. And then in the recent Oh my god, dude. He hit me. I've realized that sometimes just an immersive experience, even if it's not like crazy hardcore, is just a good time, too. Pick up item. Oh, it's my it's my quest. I just realized. Okay, that's the quest. Now, we got to take that to the to the compound earlier. Let's go check the tower if um if that dude has like a sniper scope. Oh, is that a foul? No scope on him, but is that a foul? Oh, boy. All right, let's get rid of that MP5. Wait, wait, wait. just just so we can see how the MP5 [Music] shoots. Okay, cool. We know how that works. Let's check out the [Music] foul. You're that MP5 rounders, too, is insane. What's the bullet on this? M80s penetration 22 damage 90ation level three. Uh, the F looks fun. I need a sight on this. See how this sounds. I was hoping that would sound beefier. Oh shoot. Holy. That suppression mechanic is pretty cool. straighter than you. See if we get a flank on this. How's flanking AI? Do they like see me through walls flanking kind of thing? Oh, they don't. That's pretty cool. Okay, little sketchy. Oh, I kind of remember this place. I've been here before. Okay, that was a lot of voices. We got a lot of gamers chat. I don't know where they are though. Mag check. We're close. We're about to get get uh lose lose it all. Nope. Tab. Um going to put this down here front. Whatever. Put that up there. We'll lose the mag. It's cool. Okay. So, I'm near it to my left. Oh, this is it. This is it. How do I know if if this is the right one? Is there like a notification or something? Nope. Yeah. Placed intel. Check mark. Perfect. So, that was the right one. Survive an extract from the area. Um okay. Okay, so our nearest X track's right here. It's open. Does not close. Another extract right here. That's too far. Opens in 2 minutes. Too far. Opens in 36 seconds. All right. So, just directly. We just got to fight our way out, I guess, to the west directly. Enemy spotted. Engage. Oh my goodness. That's what I heard the whole time. See what loot this has to offer cuz why not? Ooh, I was looking for that the whole time. You found one at the end of the raid, though. Let's see how this works. How do I How do I go zoom in? Zoom out. Middle mouse. Oh, toggle. Oh, so you hold middle mouse and then you scroll up. I mean, no, no, not scroll up. You move your mouse up and then Okay. All right, extract a nine. Eight. That was a That was a solid raid. Overall, a solid experience. Game definitely needs a lot of time to cook. And I'd love to see the AI to be more engaging in the future. Something like AI squads zoning in on my position as I shoot really loud guns, forcing me to want to run a suppressor for the extra tacticalness. But for only $1699, it could be a fun tactical Barbie game you could keep in your library. Three stars. Game looks amazing, but needs time to cook. This next game is one of the more highly requested games my community has asked me to check out in the last handful of months. And this video is the perfect excuse to finally check it out. It's called Hole, a single player extraction shooter for only $4.99 that looks like a game straight out of the late '90s. And this game does not hold your hand. It throws you straight in and you got to figure things out yourself. Okay, so I guess we just Oh, reload. Ooh, it it told me to mouse. Okay, microwave turn off. Wee. So, that's the extract mechanic of this game. Return home office level. Enter. Let's just go. Let's go with it. I think I have infinite ammo. Uh, I actually have no idea what I'm doing. Well, well, we're playing blind. Whatever. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's It's an extraction shooter, so I guess we just loot and figure it out as we go. The the lean gives me a little motion sickness. It's a It's a very intense lean. There's a little motion sickness involved with it for me. Or maybe I'm getting old. Whoa. Holy loot. Wait, what do I do with all this dopamine chat? Oh my god. Best game ever. Oh shoot. Okay. Okay. Reloading. Oh. Oh. Oh, you have to. Okay. The slide. I was aiming too high. Okay. Reload. And then after this chat, you got to boom. Oh, got them both. Nice. Yeah, that lean is is very intense. It's throwing me off a little bit, but okay. Money. Money is always nice. Got to grab all the money. I want to lean, but at the same time, There we go. So, always remember, mouse click. Oh, he went back to cover. That's cool. Okay, so what's important with these with these extra single player experiences is just fun AI. That was nice. That was a nice sign. So, there's a number in the bottom left that's that's continuously rising. I don't know what that is. I also don't know what I'm looting for. Okay, open that. Dude, are these SD cards or something? What is this? I don't even know what this is, but I'll take anything. That is the AI gear level. They get scarier over time. Oh, so the longer I stay, the harder they get, which kind of pushes me to to want to leave. Speaking of, he's got a Can I take a sniper? No, I don't think so. Right. I haven't Can I loot? No, I can't leave their body. No, I can't. So, what I understand as well is that AI fight each other. They're like different factions. All the AIs that look alike are friends. Maybe that's where we go. Yeah. See how they were fighting? Oh my god. Oh shoot. That was a shotgun and a half. Okay, it's getting a little more intense indeed. He's still alive. Oh, that made me sick. Oh, I just realized there's an overheat mechanic. Bottom right. Okay, I I only noticed that cuz my barrel was getting hot. All right, let's find an extract. I don't know how to extract. I I know the microwave is the extract. I don't know how to find it. Oh, here. It's extract. Let's get out of here. That was pretty fun. This game's interesting. Okay, so cash was Okay, cash was the coins. Data is the seven is the SD card looking thing. Uh, it also shows you how many of So again, each color is a different faction. We killed 14. There's four wave. We survived four waves time. Okay, retry. Let's go home first. Um, this is home. Okay. So, there's no main menu. Ooh. Okay. Ah, so build. What's the the the currency we got in game in raid? It's pretty. Okay. Okay. I see that. That is such a nice touch. Hello. What is this? Let's go talk to this show task card. Oh, okay. So, tasks. Okay. Can we accept all reward new key? I'm interested about this key. Oh, we can we can do all. Okay. So, five kill five of each. Okay. So, we go back and raid here. With my first set of quests in hand, I jumped in to eliminate five members from each AI faction. And the experience quickly got pretty intense. He's got a helmet. Since the AI difficulty increases the longer you stay in the raid, the game nails that extraction shooter adrenaline, but in a really simple, effective way. You can't linger too long or you'll start running into better geared enemies, so I had to move fast, complete my objectives, and extract before things got out of hand. It does get repetitive fairly quick, but the progression is what kept me going. Since I came into this with a blind playthrough, I was excited to see what I'd unlocked next on my base. And the biggest dopamine hit came when I completed a quest that rewarded me with a key. and I used this key to open a door and found a blue disc which once I returned home unlocked an AR-15. So that pulled me in deeper. I had to try it out even if I only had 10 round mags. My chat leader explained that the way to upgrade your weapons is to stay in the raid long enough for tougher enemies to spawn ones that drop mods. Never reached that point in my playthrough though, but it's a cool mechanic that encourages you to push your luck and stay engaged. One of my viewers summed it up perfectly. He said this might become his favorite lunch break game. Just a couple quick runs on his Steam Deck. Three and a half stars. For only $4.99, you can make lunch breaks fun again. Next is one of the most unique-l lookinging extraction shooters out there, but does it play as good as it looks? This is the Forever Winter. This is a game where you play as a scavenger. One of the narratives it tries to push is the idea that you are not the main character. Cuz when you're in raid, there's a whole war going down between three waring factions, Urusa, Europa, and Eurasia. And you are technically not part of the war. You're simply trying to make ends meet for yourself by scavenging valuables from the ongoing battles. And it's up to you how you navigate the world. Whether you decide to shoot everything on site or let the waring factions continue to fight and stay busy while you loot their scraps along the way. In today's mission though, Europa is offering me cash and gear to help them take down their Eurasian enemies. So, I accepted the offer since again I'm just trying to make ends meet here. Let's find some Eurasians. This is Europan Uruskan. So, we need 10 10 of these dudes. Europan as well. This has to be your Wait, no, that's your Ruskan. I'm looking for Eurasians. Whoops. Sorry, dude. That's Eurasian. Eurasian drone. There we go. That's uh six of 15. This is a Eurasian. Oh, well, they blew him up. All right. Thanks. This guy is Europan. We don't want that. This guy is your rusk gun. Not him either. Europan soldier. What are you fighting? Europan soldier. Europan soldier. They're all Europans. Don't get boxed in. They're probably fighting Eurasians right now. Let's go check them out. More radar. What are you guys? You're open as well. Reminds you of Gears of War. The the uh Yeah, the the point of view uh the third person definitely gives it that feel. And the the I guess the general art can give you a Gears of War feel as well. and the movement. I can see that. Okay, they all stopped fighting. Let's go to the other side of the map. Maybe we'll find more um box Eurasians on the other side. We only killed one so far. That's Europa. And who are they shooting? They're probably fighting a Eurasian. Is this I can't tag it. Hello. I I can't tell what what faction that is. Not that I want to fight a chopper, though. Look at that tank. Your rust gun still. It's Eurasian. I don't know if I want to fight a chopper though. Europan Ruskan Europan. Look for gaps. Maybe we can slip past. your Russ gun. Europan. Okay, so Europa and your Ruskan are definitely not friendly. They're fighting each other. Hold up. These are your Asians. Not going to lie, chat. I can't see what I'm shooting. I'm just uh Oh, no. I killed one, dude. I killed one in that whole army. I magnly killed one, dude. Uh, that's my kill. There we go. That's my kill. I thought I killed more than that there. Hey, leave me alone. Leave me alone. You guys stole my kills, dude. Leave me alone. Oh. Okay, we got two kills. I need I need seven more. So, you really want to watch your fire, Chad, and really uh pick your battles cuz you don't want to just shoot everything. That is a battle we don't want. Oh, that's that has to be Eurasian. Fight ahead, chat. The the the 50 cal is really slow. That's why we were whiffing our shots earlier. Look at that. Look how tough it is to Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, there we go. That felt satisfying. Holy crap. What is all this? Wait, these are Eurasian. These are Eurasian. Uhoh. Did I shoot an exo? I shot an exo. I didn't mean to shoot an exoskeleton. Those those uh those crawling cyborgs, that's all Eurasian. Oh my goodness, dude. Oh my goodness. I whiffed everything. Need four more. Come on. That's my killer right here. Right in front. Right in front. The reload takes forever. One more. Oh, right there. Come on. It's in between the legs of the exoskeleton. There we go. Let's get out of here. Completed. Call it the hero. Call the her. Call the herd, rather. I thought it said call the hero. Call the herd. That's the quest we just finished. GG. All right. Let's get out of here. So, you can theoretically run through the middle of all this fighting and uh no one's going to shoot you cuz they're too busy fighting each other. You can run and uh catch bullets though, so be careful with that. All right. GG G. Back in September of 2024, this game went viral within the extraction shooter community for doing something completely different. While most titles in the genre focus on wiping out lobbies and grabbing as much loot as possible, The Forever Winter encouraged players to pick their battles and scavenge only what they needed. It's quite a polarizing game and still is, especially since it's still very early in development. At $29.99 for an unfinished game, it definitely took some heat. Three stars. A unique take, but far from developed. Next up, Escape from Duck. Yeah, you heard that right. Tarov, but ducks. The game begins with a classic tutorial showing how movement, looting, and combat works. Oh my god, dude. Wait, wait, wait. This is actually way more satisfying than I thought it would be. Loot. Ooh, our first gun. Oh, this game is way more morbid than I thought it'd be, too. Oh, chilling. We're chilling. Okay. Yeah, that kind of hurt. It then leads us to our first extract, bringing me into my hat out where it shows me that I can upgrade both my base and my character using different materials found in Raid, and of course, some money. So, this game's got all the fundamentals of a Tarov like extraction shooter. But the question is, does it play well? I went out into the world to explore and feel out the duck combat, and along the way, I found a random house. Wait, is this guy Is this an NPC or is this an enemy? Hello? Are we friends? Who is that? Oh my god, he's got abs on him. He's jacked. Here muscles, they're gifted. How about some sastic training with me? These trainings will not only strengthen your body but also enlighten your mind. Come here. I Your master is going to assign your first challenge, dude. All right. He is a thick duck indeed. What is the first challenge quest? Oh, he's got Okay. Submit eggs. Two eggs. Satisfy the protein needs of the muscular doug. The most important aspect to concern. My first challenge is find two eggs for me. Find while doing squat walks. Go. Remember, selfless makes you free. Dude, I Whoever made this game, dude, too lazy to sit. The devs have a good sense of humor. This is good. This is good. I remember that back in my hideout, there's a vending machine where I can buy eggs. So, I decided to head home to grab some for this jack duck. But trying to get home was an adventure in itself. Oh, I was about to shoot my own pet. Okay. Okay. I was trying to see chat if I could uh if I could bait him into shooting and then I just dodged, but that's not working, dude. Okay, this guy is Can my pet please bite him or something? Okay, so you really got to got to peek him and then just um Oh, medium bullets. Don't want to hurt. You got to Oh, shoot. Oh my god. Why is everyone so juiced out of nowhere? Okay. Okay. We're We're into deep chat. We got to get home. I'm out of meds. Okay. What's the nearest extract? These guys are so juicy now. Out of nowhere. So, I got to peek and and and like mag dump. It's the It's the way. I am so hurt, though. I just realized I'm not using my my pet. I got to put stuff in my my my uh pets bag. Like, I don't know. Yarn. Put it there. Shoot. I I need to get home. Let's put the better bullets. I'm going to get dropped, dude. I never knew I'd be playing very slow and escape from Duckov. I'll be honest. Out of nowhere, this got super sweaty out of nowhere. Do that later. Oh, shoot. There's a dude in here. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm on HP. I'm on HP. Oh [ __ ] Oh my god. Oh my god. I have one tree. Oh my god, dude. One HP in a dream joy. Loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I think I should just go home. Loot. Oh my god. Let's get out of here. Oh my god. I survived with one HP. Let's get out of here, boys. All right. Welcome back. Jeez, dude. That was sweat. Barely surviving. I grabbed the two eggs at home and brought it back to the muscular duck, successfully finishing my first ever quest in Escape from Duck Offov. I then unintentionally ended up playing for about another hour, not realizing how much more fun I was having than I thought. For what it is, the game is actually pretty fun. It's currently free on Steam, but only a demo is available. No word on how much the game's going to be yet, and it plans to fully release sometime in 2025. Three and a half stars. If you can get past the fact that you're a duck, it can get addictive. And last, but definitely not the least, Zero Severt. I didn't think I'd like this game initially because of the visuals, but I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. It starts like your usual hardcore survival or extraction shooter where it does not hold your hand. You're meant to slowly discover things on your own by interacting with the world and talking to strangers. So, I spoke to this bartender who gave me full context of where I am. We're in Zero Severt, the only safe place in Zach, the city we're currently standing on that was destroyed by a huge nuclear power plant explosion. And from there, we got to figure everything else out ourselves as I was tasked to kill five wolves and in return, money and some gear from the bartender. So, I set out on my first adventure ever in the city of Zach. One thing to note is the difficulty of the game is highly customizable. I'm currently playing on the default medium difficulty of the game called Survivor. In this mode, if I die, I return back in time to the moment before we left the base, still with all my gear. At higher difficulties, you can set it to where you lose all your gear, like Tarov or even a perma death mode. But for this session, as I still try to learn the ins and outs of zero sever, I'm playing on its standard survivor mode. So, we're looking for five wolves. Oh my god. Okay, that hurt. Okay. Okay. All right. Where was his body? Oh my goodness. Oh, there it is. Ketter. Durability 50. Is it better than mine? Is it worth keeping, dude? This guy. What the was that? He's getting so much stuff on him. Bad water though. Screw nut. I guess sounds useful. Tea bag. There's so much stuff. This is again it's like Tarov all over again. Like what the hell is all this? But um this is heavy indeed. I'll move slower. I'll just drop stuff if I don't know what the what they do. Um, what is why is my not thirsty, not hungry, well-rested, not irrit Okay, I think what I want to do for now is I'm going to hover closer to my extract and see if I could farm wolves near my extract. Oh, those are bores. Hold up. Hold up. With my first death in this game, I knew that the only way to learn this game was the hard way. And I was all in. Oh my god, dude. Oh my god. You freaking extract camper. There's no way. Death after death, I gain a little more confidence and already I felt the addiction pulling me in. I started feeling it, understanding the flow of the game as I finished my first quest. And if you're wondering how I feel about this game after my first task, well, I've been playing this game a lot when I take little breaks from editing this video. Literally every break I get to catch, I'm on zero sever. I'm absolutely loving this game and I'm looking forward to doing a perma death run one day. But for now, it's a lot of learning the hard way. Five stars. Don't let the visuals fool you. Best game ever. These single player extraction shooters are a good chill time. But if you want to squeeze in some PvP, you might want to try one of these games from this video right here. Thank you to our patrons.

I tried six single player extraction shooters with one goal in mind. To find the most immersive and engaging experience you can enjoy on your own. And when I say single player, I'm talking you versus the game. No one else involved. No human friends nor human enemies. After each game, I'll rate it out of five stars. Starting with Escape from Tarov, the PVE zone. In July of 2024, Battlestate Games released the PvE zone. It's basically Tarov without humans as enemies. All opponents are replaced with AI. You could co-op with friends, but in our case, we're going completely solo. And with over 6,000 hours clocked into Tarov PvP myself, I was genuinely curious to experience if the PvE zone can provide the same immersive and engaging fun the base PVP mode brings. I had my doubts though, unsure of how challenging AI could be. But in my first raid ever in Tarov PvE, this happened. immediately humbled by AI less than 5 minutes into my first game. So, I came back for another one. This time with full respect of what my opponents can bring to the table. What? That was a dual PMC. What the What was going on, dude? That was a dual PMC and I got spotted and I'm stuck. I'm getting pushed by someone else. Oh, I got another guy to my right. I can't even see this. Okay, there's a guy to my left and guy to my right. Need to try to aggro this guy in the right. Oh, there he is. I'm not sure if that was a PMC or a Scav. The dual's pushing me. Oh my god. What? What is up with that duo? These these guys actually legit scare me. They are legit scaring me. Someone to my left as well. I'm stuck in this freaking spawn, dude. Someone's walking to my left. He's about to come out. Just walked past me. This is crazy. None of them are fighting, too. It's me against the world chat. Oh, shoot. They're just looking at me. They're looking at me. They're just looking at me. I think I dropped one. I can't see him behind the fence. Did I drop any of them? What am I doing here? Can I get out of here? There's no door. I don't remember. There's no door here, right? This is crazy. I'm pinched right out of spawn. I can barely see them through that fence. There's walking to my left and to my right and none of them none of them are fighting. Yeah, I do have nades. The thing is like I just got to get rid of them. If I nade them, they just they just displace, right? I didn't kill any of them. Oh, I got one. I got I see one dead body right there. Can't open that door right there. We heard movement to the left. Okay, it's a it's a bare PMC to my left. So, we got to be careful with that dude. I don't know where this guy is. So, we did drop one. The other PMC though is still alive. I have no idea where he is. So, I have cover to my left, which is good. We heard him. He's close, right? He's behind his SUV. Okay, so we have to get rid of the guy on the right. Guy to my left just holding me as well. I guess we could grenade this guy here. Oh my god, dude. I have no idea where that was from. Dude, what is going on here? Actual horror game, chat. Oh, he's right here. He's going to push. He's pushing my heal. He's pushing my heal. That guy's dead. I've never been stuck in this corner for so long in my whole Tarov life. Okay, so it seems like right side's clear. There's a PMC in the left side earlier who's holding me. I'm trying to figure out how I can maybe I can grenade this dude out of the way. I think I might have just grenaded myself. Yeah, it I hit the freaking top. So, a bunch of dead PMC. I do want to loot these guys. Man, I swear if I start looting, I'm going to get shot. I feel it. Do I leave this guy chat? He looks chill. Dealing with PV is no joke. Super fine. Super fine. I don't want his dog tag to be fair. We're super super chill. Very chill right now. What is this? PS rounds. Yeah. Yeah, it's PS. We drop this mag. As like a first timer in PvE, I'm still trying to gauge the AI and it's very scary gauging them right now, chat. I will not lie. This guy is juiced. He's high level 17. This guy is gaming. This guy doesn't He's He's no life in touch grass. Level 17 gamer. Okay, we're good. That leaves no lifing. 15 minutes in and I've moved 10 m. After successfully clearing my immediate area and looting every drop of gear, I finally made it out of my spawn. Got out of this basement area and into the surface level, hoping to safely make my way to a nearby office to grab a hard drive for a quest. My goal for each single player extraction shooter is to finish at least one quest before allowing myself to move on to the next game. So, I carefully cleared my corners, grabbed the quest key from a nearby dead scientist, slowly made my way up to the offices, unlocked the door, grabbed my quest item, and sweatily but safely made it to extract. That was pretty sweaty. I like that experience. That was cool. Tarov PvE exceeded my expectations. I was immersed and completely engaged. The only downside is it's pricey cuz you'll need to buy the base game at $50, then buy the PV expansion for another 20, making it a $70 investment, which can be a big ask. But for one of the best extraction shooter experiences you can get out there, it might be worth your hard-earned money. Four out of five stars. Sweaty but expensive. Next up, another tactical PVE only extraction shooter that again, like Tarov PvE, you can either play solo or with friends. This is Incursion Red River. I actually had the chance to play this nearly a year ago for another video, but at the time I wasn't a huge fan of PvE extraction shooters. So, I was pretty critical about this game. But as the genre continues to evolve, I've come to appreciate why PvE extraction shooters exist. Not everyone wants the stress of PvP or the frustration of dealing with cheaters, both of which have ruined the experience of PvP extraction shooters for many. With that in mind, I returned to this game with a fresh perspective, approaching this session with intention, ready to fully immerse myself in the world of Incursion Red River. And it wasn't hard to do that cuz this game is absolutely gorgeous. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it takes advantage of how much you can push the engine visually. All right, we got the 74M with a flashlight. We put a a B10M on this and a foregrip. I don't remember what for grip we put. Let's go single fire. Oh, I pressed BB. Seems to be holster. So that's semi x. I'm going to go semi for now. Let's uh sorry. Oh, reload night vision. Okay, I like this. This is pressing M actually brought this out. Mag check. Hold R. Emergency reload. Drops mag double R. Normal reload. Let's do a mag check. Just see how it looks. Okay, that's a mag check. Cool. Flashlight. Uh four is the is the map thing, right? There we go. Secure intel. So, I accepted a quest to secure a document and delivered to a marked dropbox on the other side of the map. With my objective clear, I set out on the hunt. The g the movement feels really good. It actually feels good. Especially like you know how like most of our games that are like Tarov are so freaking clunky, Tarov included, the movement can get clunky. This one feels pretty smooth. They didn't go for the uh mega clunky realism kind of thing. It's more of accessible feeling. I was prepared. Feels actually pretty good. But not probably behind that wall there. Okay, hold up. Hold up. I don't know where I am. I'm going to walk here. So, what I can imagine based on like the feel so far, dude, where was that voice? That dude sounded like he was above me. He's not above me. Is what I what I can imagine here is this is definitely a game that I feel you could just be immersive with your friends with. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm right. Going up here. The other's board, too. He must be up here, cuz he sounded like he was right above me earlier, but he's not. Sector clear. Moving the next sector. Taking fire. Need assistance. Probably not a head shot. Voice voice acting is pretty good. Can I jump here? Let's hug this red wall. Damn, the game looks really good. Okay. Uh, one thing I want to check. Let's go check how how magp packing works. Or is it instapac like um Oops. I keep pressing I. Okay. Currently instack, which is fine. Just wondering. It's like placeholder for now, I assume. Okay, let's loot. Hold F to loot. Ooh, that looks nice. A saw and painkillers. We take those. That aug looked pretty nice. Let's inspect. I to inspect. Let's go try this. Okay, I got to keep checking the map. I am just 100% lost right now. Okay, so you can see the other mark on the base. Okay, that's what I was looking for. There's a white box marker south of you at the map. Yeah, so this is this is the one we were looking at, right? Or are you talking about further south? So I'm looking for the other marker. Or is this the is this the only marker? Is there any other marker that I'm where I'm supposed to grab the thing? You can see the other mark on the base. Oh, dude. I did not see that. That was Okay, I get it now. I get it, dude. It was so camouflaged. It was pretty camouflaged, not going to lie. Okay. Well, there's a dude right there. Do I I don't think I want to shoot now. Um I'm like in a weird spot. I don't even have range. Security move. All right, dude. I'm going to hug that container. So, our objective is somewhere here. Wait, we saw the dude up here rather. So, let's not let's be careful of that. I hear footsteps next to me. I can't tell if he's actually here. Activity reported. Proceed with caution. Oh, take cover. Someone's close left here on the corner. I remember seeing someone up there. Was that the building with the stairs? the Oh my goodness. There's someone here. This AUG hits feels like it hits harder than my AK because the bullets are better slightly. Felt like earlier my AK was just they were just tanking my AK bullets. This has I think um a little more pen. [Music] Hold up. That guy didn't shoot me the whole time. Oh. [Music] He was hiding behind cover. You see his animation chat? He's hiding behind cover, but there was a window. But um yeah, cheat to that guy. One thing I'm um starting to like learn about these types of games is that um I always felt like every tactical shooter has to be very challenging to be fun. And then in the recent Oh my god, dude. He hit me. I've realized that sometimes just an immersive experience, even if it's not like crazy hardcore, is just a good time, too. Pick up item. Oh, it's my it's my quest. I just realized. Okay, that's the quest. Now, we got to take that to the to the compound earlier. Let's go check the tower if um if that dude has like a sniper scope. Oh, is that a foul? No scope on him, but is that a foul? Oh, boy. All right, let's get rid of that MP5. Wait, wait, wait. just just so we can see how the MP5 [Music] shoots. Okay, cool. We know how that works. Let's check out the [Music] foul. You're that MP5 rounders, too, is insane. What's the bullet on this? M80s penetration 22 damage 90ation level three. Uh, the F looks fun. I need a sight on this. See how this sounds. I was hoping that would sound beefier. Oh shoot. Holy. That suppression mechanic is pretty cool. straighter than you. See if we get a flank on this. How's flanking AI? Do they like see me through walls flanking kind of thing? Oh, they don't. That's pretty cool. Okay, little sketchy. Oh, I kind of remember this place. I've been here before. Okay, that was a lot of voices. We got a lot of gamers chat. I don't know where they are though. Mag check. We're close. We're about to get get uh lose lose it all. Nope. Tab. Um going to put this down here front. Whatever. Put that up there. We'll lose the mag. It's cool. Okay. So, I'm near it to my left. Oh, this is it. This is it. How do I know if if this is the right one? Is there like a notification or something? Nope. Yeah. Placed intel. Check mark. Perfect. So, that was the right one. Survive an extract from the area. Um okay. Okay, so our nearest X track's right here. It's open. Does not close. Another extract right here. That's too far. Opens in 2 minutes. Too far. Opens in 36 seconds. All right. So, just directly. We just got to fight our way out, I guess, to the west directly. Enemy spotted. Engage. Oh my goodness. That's what I heard the whole time. See what loot this has to offer cuz why not? Ooh, I was looking for that the whole time. You found one at the end of the raid, though. Let's see how this works. How do I How do I go zoom in? Zoom out. Middle mouse. Oh, toggle. Oh, so you hold middle mouse and then you scroll up. I mean, no, no, not scroll up. You move your mouse up and then Okay. All right, extract a nine. Eight. That was a That was a solid raid. Overall, a solid experience. Game definitely needs a lot of time to cook. And I'd love to see the AI to be more engaging in the future. Something like AI squads zoning in on my position as I shoot really loud guns, forcing me to want to run a suppressor for the extra tacticalness. But for only $1699, it could be a fun tactical Barbie game you could keep in your library. Three stars. Game looks amazing, but needs time to cook. This next game is one of the more highly requested games my community has asked me to check out in the last handful of months. And this video is the perfect excuse to finally check it out. It's called Hole, a single player extraction shooter for only $4.99 that looks like a game straight out of the late '90s. And this game does not hold your hand. It throws you straight in and you got to figure things out yourself. Okay, so I guess we just Oh, reload. Ooh, it it told me to mouse. Okay, microwave turn off. Wee. So, that's the extract mechanic of this game. Return home office level. Enter. Let's just go. Let's go with it. I think I have infinite ammo. Uh, I actually have no idea what I'm doing. Well, well, we're playing blind. Whatever. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's It's an extraction shooter, so I guess we just loot and figure it out as we go. The the lean gives me a little motion sickness. It's a It's a very intense lean. There's a little motion sickness involved with it for me. Or maybe I'm getting old. Whoa. Holy loot. Wait, what do I do with all this dopamine chat? Oh my god. Best game ever. Oh shoot. Okay. Okay. Reloading. Oh. Oh. Oh, you have to. Okay. The slide. I was aiming too high. Okay. Reload. And then after this chat, you got to boom. Oh, got them both. Nice. Yeah, that lean is is very intense. It's throwing me off a little bit, but okay. Money. Money is always nice. Got to grab all the money. I want to lean, but at the same time, There we go. So, always remember, mouse click. Oh, he went back to cover. That's cool. Okay, so what's important with these with these extra single player experiences is just fun AI. That was nice. That was a nice sign. So, there's a number in the bottom left that's that's continuously rising. I don't know what that is. I also don't know what I'm looting for. Okay, open that. Dude, are these SD cards or something? What is this? I don't even know what this is, but I'll take anything. That is the AI gear level. They get scarier over time. Oh, so the longer I stay, the harder they get, which kind of pushes me to to want to leave. Speaking of, he's got a Can I take a sniper? No, I don't think so. Right. I haven't Can I loot? No, I can't leave their body. No, I can't. So, what I understand as well is that AI fight each other. They're like different factions. All the AIs that look alike are friends. Maybe that's where we go. Yeah. See how they were fighting? Oh my god. Oh shoot. That was a shotgun and a half. Okay, it's getting a little more intense indeed. He's still alive. Oh, that made me sick. Oh, I just realized there's an overheat mechanic. Bottom right. Okay, I I only noticed that cuz my barrel was getting hot. All right, let's find an extract. I don't know how to extract. I I know the microwave is the extract. I don't know how to find it. Oh, here. It's extract. Let's get out of here. That was pretty fun. This game's interesting. Okay, so cash was Okay, cash was the coins. Data is the seven is the SD card looking thing. Uh, it also shows you how many of So again, each color is a different faction. We killed 14. There's four wave. We survived four waves time. Okay, retry. Let's go home first. Um, this is home. Okay. So, there's no main menu. Ooh. Okay. Ah, so build. What's the the the currency we got in game in raid? It's pretty. Okay. Okay. I see that. That is such a nice touch. Hello. What is this? Let's go talk to this show task card. Oh, okay. So, tasks. Okay. Can we accept all reward new key? I'm interested about this key. Oh, we can we can do all. Okay. So, five kill five of each. Okay. So, we go back and raid here. With my first set of quests in hand, I jumped in to eliminate five members from each AI faction. And the experience quickly got pretty intense. He's got a helmet. Since the AI difficulty increases the longer you stay in the raid, the game nails that extraction shooter adrenaline, but in a really simple, effective way. You can't linger too long or you'll start running into better geared enemies, so I had to move fast, complete my objectives, and extract before things got out of hand. It does get repetitive fairly quick, but the progression is what kept me going. Since I came into this with a blind playthrough, I was excited to see what I'd unlocked next on my base. And the biggest dopamine hit came when I completed a quest that rewarded me with a key. and I used this key to open a door and found a blue disc which once I returned home unlocked an AR-15. So that pulled me in deeper. I had to try it out even if I only had 10 round mags. My chat leader explained that the way to upgrade your weapons is to stay in the raid long enough for tougher enemies to spawn ones that drop mods. Never reached that point in my playthrough though, but it's a cool mechanic that encourages you to push your luck and stay engaged. One of my viewers summed it up perfectly. He said this might become his favorite lunch break game. Just a couple quick runs on his Steam Deck. Three and a half stars. For only $4.99, you can make lunch breaks fun again. Next is one of the most unique-l lookinging extraction shooters out there, but does it play as good as it looks? This is the Forever Winter. This is a game where you play as a scavenger. One of the narratives it tries to push is the idea that you are not the main character. Cuz when you're in raid, there's a whole war going down between three waring factions, Urusa, Europa, and Eurasia. And you are technically not part of the war. You're simply trying to make ends meet for yourself by scavenging valuables from the ongoing battles. And it's up to you how you navigate the world. Whether you decide to shoot everything on site or let the waring factions continue to fight and stay busy while you loot their scraps along the way. In today's mission though, Europa is offering me cash and gear to help them take down their Eurasian enemies. So, I accepted the offer since again I'm just trying to make ends meet here. Let's find some Eurasians. This is Europan Uruskan. So, we need 10 10 of these dudes. Europan as well. This has to be your Wait, no, that's your Ruskan. I'm looking for Eurasians. Whoops. Sorry, dude. That's Eurasian. Eurasian drone. There we go. That's uh six of 15. This is a Eurasian. Oh, well, they blew him up. All right. Thanks. This guy is Europan. We don't want that. This guy is your rusk gun. Not him either. Europan soldier. What are you fighting? Europan soldier. Europan soldier. They're all Europans. Don't get boxed in. They're probably fighting Eurasians right now. Let's go check them out. More radar. What are you guys? You're open as well. Reminds you of Gears of War. The the uh Yeah, the the point of view uh the third person definitely gives it that feel. And the the I guess the general art can give you a Gears of War feel as well. and the movement. I can see that. Okay, they all stopped fighting. Let's go to the other side of the map. Maybe we'll find more um box Eurasians on the other side. We only killed one so far. That's Europa. And who are they shooting? They're probably fighting a Eurasian. Is this I can't tag it. Hello. I I can't tell what what faction that is. Not that I want to fight a chopper, though. Look at that tank. Your rust gun still. It's Eurasian. I don't know if I want to fight a chopper though. Europan Ruskan Europan. Look for gaps. Maybe we can slip past. your Russ gun. Europan. Okay, so Europa and your Ruskan are definitely not friendly. They're fighting each other. Hold up. These are your Asians. Not going to lie, chat. I can't see what I'm shooting. I'm just uh Oh, no. I killed one, dude. I killed one in that whole army. I magnly killed one, dude. Uh, that's my kill. There we go. That's my kill. I thought I killed more than that there. Hey, leave me alone. Leave me alone. You guys stole my kills, dude. Leave me alone. Oh. Okay, we got two kills. I need I need seven more. So, you really want to watch your fire, Chad, and really uh pick your battles cuz you don't want to just shoot everything. That is a battle we don't want. Oh, that's that has to be Eurasian. Fight ahead, chat. The the the 50 cal is really slow. That's why we were whiffing our shots earlier. Look at that. Look how tough it is to Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, there we go. That felt satisfying. Holy crap. What is all this? Wait, these are Eurasian. These are Eurasian. Uhoh. Did I shoot an exo? I shot an exo. I didn't mean to shoot an exoskeleton. Those those uh those crawling cyborgs, that's all Eurasian. Oh my goodness, dude. Oh my goodness. I whiffed everything. Need four more. Come on. That's my killer right here. Right in front. Right in front. The reload takes forever. One more. Oh, right there. Come on. It's in between the legs of the exoskeleton. There we go. Let's get out of here. Completed. Call it the hero. Call the her. Call the herd, rather. I thought it said call the hero. Call the herd. That's the quest we just finished. GG. All right. Let's get out of here. So, you can theoretically run through the middle of all this fighting and uh no one's going to shoot you cuz they're too busy fighting each other. You can run and uh catch bullets though, so be careful with that. All right. GG G. Back in September of 2024, this game went viral within the extraction shooter community for doing something completely different. While most titles in the genre focus on wiping out lobbies and grabbing as much loot as possible, The Forever Winter encouraged players to pick their battles and scavenge only what they needed. It's quite a polarizing game and still is, especially since it's still very early in development. At $29.99 for an unfinished game, it definitely took some heat. Three stars. A unique take, but far from developed. Next up, Escape from Duck. Yeah, you heard that right. Tarov, but ducks. The game begins with a classic tutorial showing how movement, looting, and combat works. Oh my god, dude. Wait, wait, wait. This is actually way more satisfying than I thought it would be. Loot. Ooh, our first gun. Oh, this game is way more morbid than I thought it'd be, too. Oh, chilling. We're chilling. Okay. Yeah, that kind of hurt. It then leads us to our first extract, bringing me into my hat out where it shows me that I can upgrade both my base and my character using different materials found in Raid, and of course, some money. So, this game's got all the fundamentals of a Tarov like extraction shooter. But the question is, does it play well? I went out into the world to explore and feel out the duck combat, and along the way, I found a random house. Wait, is this guy Is this an NPC or is this an enemy? Hello? Are we friends? Who is that? Oh my god, he's got abs on him. He's jacked. Here muscles, they're gifted. How about some sastic training with me? These trainings will not only strengthen your body but also enlighten your mind. Come here. I Your master is going to assign your first challenge, dude. All right. He is a thick duck indeed. What is the first challenge quest? Oh, he's got Okay. Submit eggs. Two eggs. Satisfy the protein needs of the muscular doug. The most important aspect to concern. My first challenge is find two eggs for me. Find while doing squat walks. Go. Remember, selfless makes you free. Dude, I Whoever made this game, dude, too lazy to sit. The devs have a good sense of humor. This is good. This is good. I remember that back in my hideout, there's a vending machine where I can buy eggs. So, I decided to head home to grab some for this jack duck. But trying to get home was an adventure in itself. Oh, I was about to shoot my own pet. Okay. Okay. I was trying to see chat if I could uh if I could bait him into shooting and then I just dodged, but that's not working, dude. Okay, this guy is Can my pet please bite him or something? Okay, so you really got to got to peek him and then just um Oh, medium bullets. Don't want to hurt. You got to Oh, shoot. Oh my god. Why is everyone so juiced out of nowhere? Okay. Okay. We're We're into deep chat. We got to get home. I'm out of meds. Okay. What's the nearest extract? These guys are so juicy now. Out of nowhere. So, I got to peek and and and like mag dump. It's the It's the way. I am so hurt, though. I just realized I'm not using my my pet. I got to put stuff in my my my uh pets bag. Like, I don't know. Yarn. Put it there. Shoot. I I need to get home. Let's put the better bullets. I'm going to get dropped, dude. I never knew I'd be playing very slow and escape from Duckov. I'll be honest. Out of nowhere, this got super sweaty out of nowhere. Do that later. Oh, shoot. There's a dude in here. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm on HP. I'm on HP. Oh [ __ ] Oh my god. Oh my god. I have one tree. Oh my god, dude. One HP in a dream joy. Loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I think I should just go home. Loot. Oh my god. Let's get out of here. Oh my god. I survived with one HP. Let's get out of here, boys. All right. Welcome back. Jeez, dude. That was sweat. Barely surviving. I grabbed the two eggs at home and brought it back to the muscular duck, successfully finishing my first ever quest in Escape from Duck Offov. I then unintentionally ended up playing for about another hour, not realizing how much more fun I was having than I thought. For what it is, the game is actually pretty fun. It's currently free on Steam, but only a demo is available. No word on how much the game's going to be yet, and it plans to fully release sometime in 2025. Three and a half stars. If you can get past the fact that you're a duck, it can get addictive. And last, but definitely not the least, Zero Severt. I didn't think I'd like this game initially because of the visuals, but I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. It starts like your usual hardcore survival or extraction shooter where it does not hold your hand. You're meant to slowly discover things on your own by interacting with the world and talking to strangers. So, I spoke to this bartender who gave me full context of where I am. We're in Zero Severt, the only safe place in Zach, the city we're currently standing on that was destroyed by a huge nuclear power plant explosion. And from there, we got to figure everything else out ourselves as I was tasked to kill five wolves and in return, money and some gear from the bartender. So, I set out on my first adventure ever in the city of Zach. One thing to note is the difficulty of the game is highly customizable. I'm currently playing on the default medium difficulty of the game called Survivor. In this mode, if I die, I return back in time to the moment before we left the base, still with all my gear. At higher difficulties, you can set it to where you lose all your gear, like Tarov or even a perma death mode. But for this session, as I still try to learn the ins and outs of zero sever, I'm playing on its standard survivor mode. So, we're looking for five wolves. Oh my god. Okay, that hurt. Okay. Okay. All right. Where was his body? Oh my goodness. Oh, there it is. Ketter. Durability 50. Is it better than mine? Is it worth keeping, dude? This guy. What the was that? He's getting so much stuff on him. Bad water though. Screw nut. I guess sounds useful. Tea bag. There's so much stuff. This is again it's like Tarov all over again. Like what the hell is all this? But um this is heavy indeed. I'll move slower. I'll just drop stuff if I don't know what the what they do. Um, what is why is my not thirsty, not hungry, well-rested, not irrit Okay, I think what I want to do for now is I'm going to hover closer to my extract and see if I could farm wolves near my extract. Oh, those are bores. Hold up. Hold up. With my first death in this game, I knew that the only way to learn this game was the hard way. And I was all in. Oh my god, dude. Oh my god. You freaking extract camper. There's no way. Death after death, I gain a little more confidence and already I felt the addiction pulling me in. I started feeling it, understanding the flow of the game as I finished my first quest. And if you're wondering how I feel about this game after my first task, well, I've been playing this game a lot when I take little breaks from editing this video. Literally every break I get to catch, I'm on zero sever. I'm absolutely loving this game and I'm looking forward to doing a perma death run one day. But for now, it's a lot of learning the hard way. Five stars. Don't let the visuals fool you. Best game ever. These single player extraction shooters are a good chill time. But if you want to squeeze in some PvP, you might want to try one of these games from this video right here. Thank you to our patrons.
