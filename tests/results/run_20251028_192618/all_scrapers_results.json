      "content": "Well everyone, today we're trying something a little different. We are trying Arena Breakout Infinite, which just launched on Steam and is a freeto-play hardcore tactical extraction shooter that you should play without uh being distracted with uh doing a video intro. That's a bad idea. Spin move. Spin move. Running. Okay. Okay. Just lesson learned. Okay. I shouldn't I shouldn't record intros while we're while we're doing stuff. It's a bad idea. Bad idea. I'm going to get jumped. Now, I've actually played a lot of Extraction Shooters in the last year or so. So, when the devs over at More Fun Studios, the guys behind Arena Breakout Infinite, offered me the chance to try the game and share it with you in a video, I said, \"Sure, as long as I'm allowed to say whatever I want to say.\" And they said, \"Absolutely. Say whatever you want to say. We just want you to play the game and share it with your audience.\" And that's what we're doing today. So, thank you to More Fun Studios and Arena Breakout Infinite for sponsoring the video. But rest assured, I'm going to tell you what I think. And it just so happens that I am pretty impressed. Now, I've actually been playing it for a few days, and there's a bunch of little bitty quality of life things that are really important in an extraction shooter, in my opinion, that they get right here. For one, it's free to play, meaning that you can just load in and try it for yourself to see if it's your type of game and if it feels good to you, which is important because this type of game is not for everybody. And if you want to play with your buddies or at least get them introduced to the genre or to this specific game now, they can just easily get into it. But even if you want to play it solo, there are solo modes, duos modes, and of course the kind of core trios mode, which the game is mostly built around. There's all sorts of little touches. Like for example, if I want to check how many rounds I have in my magazine, you'll notice it's not on the UI like on screen. But if I just go alt t, you actually check the magazine by hand. You can actually like physically check it. If I swap to my shotgun and check that way, you can see, okay, I've got about half left. Okay, so maybe this would be a time to reload if I had ammunition. And once you start reloading, it plays out in real time. And so you can't just play willy-nilly. You know, this is not like a light-hearted Call of Duty type shooter. This is much more hardcore and tactical, even down to something as small in detail as the ability to sway and lean around corners to peak it. Now, they have five different maps right now available for you to try. And they have different playlists and loadouts available for missions with all different modes, for highle play, for introductory play. So, there's all sorts of different ways for you to sink your teeth into it, whether you're a new player or a very experienced one. And I will say the sound design is really good, and you'll find yourself listening very carefully. You hear that? You might need headphones, but you can hear the shots in the distance, and it's from behind the metal, so I know that there's a team in there looting it. So, I could I could set up camp here and just wait to snipe them if I wanted to to be a bit of a troll. Uh oh, my buddy's getting jumped. Uh yeah, I really I really need to be better about filming these videos with teammates. I feel so bad cuz I'll like go off and I'm filming something, I'm talking and rambling, and then my buddy gets jumped and uh that's just what happens. Oh, he's done. I'm sorry, dude. I'm so sorry. I am purely to blame now because this is a hardcore tactical extraction shooter. My teammate's just done. He's just dead and his stuff is gone. And that's sad for him. Again, I am to blame. This is my fault. But uh there's not much I can do about it now. You know, there's not a lot of, you know, quick res or anything. That's not really how this game works. You might also notice, for example, that I have that little orange minus uh ear icon in the bottom left. And that's actually an indication based on my load out. I'm wearing a helmet that actually suppresses sound. So, I can't hear cues as clearly as if I weren't wearing a helmet. They actually adjust the audio and uh audio balancing based on the equipment you have on, which is super super cool. Certain helmets, for example, have a visor that will literally limit your field of view. It's just really really carefully thought out and well executed if you ask me. Now, like I mentioned, there's a bunch of different maps and game modes for you to try out. I've played in multiple. My personal favorite is probably the TV station. Because it's a TV station, there's a bunch of different small vignettes built as sets throughout the station, and it creates for some really fun encounters where each individual encounter can take place in a totally different micro setting. It's It's very interesting and cool. Not to mention the tight corridors make it really, really intense when you're trying to hunt down other teams and take their loot. It's just really well executed in my opinion. It's big enough for you to get lost in and to find a bunch of new interesting stuff, but it's also intimate and tight enough in the important areas that you don't feel as though players can just run away from you and escape when you get to jump on them. They also have a limited time storm event going on right now where they take the farm map and add a ton of extra challenging things to it such as intense rain, a bunch of wind, heavy fog, reduced visibility, and the rain makes it louder so you can't hear enemies coming. It just takes all the knobs and turns them up to 11. It is much more intense. Another aspect of the game that I think is so so important in an extraction shooter or really any hardcore any type of game is that it needs to feel fair. Like it needs to feel as though when you died it's because you did something wrong or your team screwed up. Like it shouldn't feel as though the game just misbehaved. And I will give them credit. They've done a really really good job of tightening this up. Like I said, the game existed before it launched on Steam, but now that it's on Steam, a whole new wave of players are finding it, and it is just really well put together. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the movement to the inventory system and the actual builds of weapons and armor sets and everything. It's just all so robust and sturdy and well put together that it makes it feel like if somebody got to jump on you, it's your own fault. You weren't listening close enough. you weren't paying attention or you know you were recording the intro for a YouTube video while your buddy was alone off in the distance. Oh, like right here. I just heard a dude walking around. Okay, so there's a guard there. There are going to be some NPC guards on patrol, but then there's also players that will of course be exploring as you are doing your thing. And you just never really know. You can usually tell like visually they'll be wearing different outfits and loadouts, but but sometimes you just got to be cautious. I just heard somebody. That's a regular guard. He's just doing his thing. This game makes you so paranoid. I swear it's it's kind of awesome because I mean it's a tactical extraction shooter. You should play it very cautiously and not be playing like crazy. But, you know, I guess it's just proof that the game's working. It's making me act all crazy and hyper paranoid. Now, personally, I think my favorite part of the game that I've encountered so far is actually the weapon building, assembly, and modification system within the gunsmith. This is basically a system you can use when you're building out your loadout to go into a match. And it allows you to either build guns using attachments you already have, or you can buy them from an in-game store where other players can sell items they've collected, or you can buy them from a merchant that the developers have basically built out for you, though that's for a higher price typically. And there is a ton of customization, whether it's the barrel that you use, the specific rail you attach your scope to, the scopes of course, suppressors, compensators, muzzles, chokes, you name it, they've got it. and it allows you to build exactly the kind of gun that you want um for your play style, which again I appreciate. I tend to be kind of slow and steady, scout heavy, snipe heavy. Like that's just how I tend to play all sorts of games, but that's just me. Other people are going to be much more run and gun probably running in with SMGs and shotguns and stuff, and that's totally fine. In which case, you can build it out the way you want. Oh my god. Oh my god. These are all just the NPCs, so they're like not that dangerous, but they are just annoying enough for you to need to pay attention. He's wearing a helmet, so I don't think that domed him. Oh my god. Come on, Pika. There we go. Okay, not my proudest moment. I missed a few of those. Now, I was trying to come up with things that I had like frustrations over. Ooh, a hydraulic wrench for 65,000. That's nice. I was trying to like come up with the the points of frustration that I have with the game if there are any. And honestly, I don't really have any firm notes. Like I think it's a really wellexecuted extraction shooter and they've done a really good job. They've even directly responded to people's frustrations over like potential payto-in aspects of a game like this, which is crucial in a free-to-play game that it's not just pay to win, which is something that you can sometimes end up with in games like this. So, in response for this update, they actually removed the ability to buy the in-game currency you use to purchase gun attachments and stuff, meaning now it's just cosmetics only, which again, I think is really, really good, really healthy for the long-term life cycle of the game because it now means again when I go into an encounter, if I get jumped and get outplayed, it's because the other player just had better equipment or or was a better player probably realistically. And it was not because they just spent more money. It was because they knew what they were doing. And I'll be honest, so far that's been my experience in the game when I encounter other players. It's usually because they were posted up tactically and they were watching for me. They listened closer than I was. I wasn't paying full attention to the environment and I could have seen some indication that they had been there, like an open door, but I just wasn't thinking about it. And that's exactly what you would hope to see in a tactical extraction shooter. things that are fair, balanced, and that you could have picked up on if you had been paying more attention. One of the other things I commonly have to bring up with extraction shooters is the ability to play solo because these games can often be so dependent on other players filling out your team that one bad matchup can ruin your entire evening of playing games. Like if you grind out for hours collecting all this amazing loot and then you get matched with one random set of teammates that just are terrible, it can ruin your entire time with the game because they get you killed and you lose all of your stuff. And so having a solo queue can be really really nice because it means that you can just get in there, play by yourself. You don't have to worry about anybody else affecting it. It is just you and other solo players. And that for me is wonderful, especially if the game is balanced in a way where that can still be fun. That really makes a difference for me uh and the type of player that I am. And like I said, they have solo cues, they have duos as well in this game. And because it is free to play, you can just ask your buddies if they want to hop on with you, play around or two, and you can do that because there's no barrier to entry. You just download it and do it that way. You'll notice when I pull up the map, there's actually numerous extraction sites and different like points of interest on this one map. Like I said, there's five maps for you to choose from when you go into a match. But like this one, in order to unlock it, I have to search any five unarched weapon cases as a team to extract. This one, the canal gate is closed. Find the switch in the second floor of the control room to open it. This one though is active after 15 minutes of the raid. This one is a secret patch passage open 15 minutes after the raid starts. So you can pick which one you want and then go on from there. I will mention that my experience so far with other players and random matched teams in the game has actually been quite positive. They've been supportive and helpful and when we went into voice chat, they were actually helping me understand the game and learn some of the tips and tricks. And it was quite refreshing honestly to play a hardcore game where the community was just supportive and nice and kind and excited to have new players in the lobby and server with them which is not an experience I've had in a lot of other hardcore games. So it was nice to see cuz the community is not something you can like market into a game. It's not something you can force. It's just something that happens emergently. Like if the community is is chill that's awesome because you cannot fake it. You can't buy a good community. It just is what it is. And amazingly enough, they have a really, really seemingly kind and supportive community in this game, which is not something I can say about every game I've tried. So, props to whoever is responsible for that. I mean, maybe it's just luck of the draw or whatever, but ultimately, I guess it's the community themselves that should be should be uh thanked and proud of it cuz they're the ones doing it. But they've done a great job and honestly, it's so refreshing to see it. Oh, yeah. They were totally here. See, they're searching all of this. They dumped some other stuff they didn't need and then they extracted 1,000%. Okay. Well, I think that means I'm alone now. I think I think I'm solo. Well, in that case, we're good to extract. So, I'm just going to go stand in the extract zone for 10 seconds and then get out. I didn't collect a whole lot of stuff, but you know, we we proved the point that even a dude like me can extract. They also have a really cool like recap system in the game. So you can see everywhere you traveled and ran and where you didn't go. So next match maybe I go over to the armory and I search there because that's kind of like the main thing on this map. You can see a different timestamps when you either found a a unique piece of uh loot or maybe you went in and you found a a specific enemy and eliminated them. Like it's just a cool recap. I like that. But then after the match we're good to go in again. We just hit enter and we can choose which mode we want. normal lockdown which is like the next tier above that forbidden zone which is much higher tier. It's the extreme danger and just to play this mode you basically select which map you want to do and then you see there is a minimum value 300,000 and a 50,000 buyin. So it's not something you're just going to casually do when you first start playing. This is more endgame stuff. Similarly, they also have the solo ops mode which you can select there and then choose whichever map is currently available for it. It also has a minimum value as well to make it worth it for the other players if they happen to jump you. But once you select the map that you want, you select that. And let's say we're going to go Northridge. Let's select that. And then we're going to prepare our load out. And as you can see here, like I wanted more magazines for my rifle. So I just unload it. I have it here in my inventory. And these are those little like quality of life improvements. You just rightclick, you can search for it, and then you can find it available for sale. from other players or the marketplace more generally. And then you can just buy them if you need them using the in-game currency you've collected by selling other things you've collected. And then I have plenty of these uh magazines available to me. You can see when you highlight stuff, it also highlights the ammunition for that weapon and the magazines. So I can just like drag in a couple more of these if I want to have even more. I just drag on top of them the ammunition to load them up. I can also like just leave that in there. I drop the the mag into the rifle. Boom. I have it. Easy peasy. Lemon squeezy. I want more of this ammo. I can either transfer it from my inventory if I already have it, which in this case I do. I've got plenty. So, I can do that. And uh I'm I'm good to go. And then we load in, we pay our fee, and we start matchmaking to get in there. Again, it's all these little quality of life improvements and things that have not been in some of the extraction shooters I've tried this year. Let's just say that. Not calling anybody out, but you would hope to see some of this little bitty stuff that just makes it easier to get in and actually play the game and to just quickly do things like managing your inventory or your weapons or ammunition. I just love to see those things added here in a free-to-play game as well. It's just again really nice. And voila, we are in ready to go. You can select your POIs like if I want to get to Oh no. Oh no. So that that's what I get. That's what I get. You know, these these types of games can be difficult to film videos in because like you load in, it's like, okay, we're there. You pop in, you open the map to select where you're going, and boom, somebody spotted you and you're dead. Like 58 seconds is how long I technically was in the match while I was loading in and getting set up. At least, you know, it seems like it was a hardcore player that does this a lot. OP eliminations, total damage dealt, 400k, total value, 853 million. This is somebody who who has played a lot, so they know what they're doing. They were they might have been camping the spawn. You never know. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see him get me. As I'm like standing there opening the map, you can see. Okay, let's get in the game, guys. I'm really excited. He's like, what is this loser doing? And then I'm trying to frantically close the map and then Oh, well. Yeah, that's kind of my fault. Well played. What a way to end it. Thank you again to More Fun Games for sponsoring the video, giving me the chance to check it out. I'm actually having a really, really good time. And again, I can't say that about every extraction shooter I've played this year. um that got quite old quite quick. And this one has a lot more content, a lot more quality of life improvements, which are also really good to see. And um when you die, you also get a clean recap of exactly what they used on you, what weapons they used, what ammo they used, where the bullets hit, and everything, which is honestly kind of cool. Um I died because of the hit to the head. And uh there we go. There you go. But of course, if you want to check out the game yourself, it'll be linked in the description box below. And like I said, it's free to play, so you can just download it on Steam, check it out, see if it's up your alley, and give it a shot. But with all that said, thank you for watching. I love you all desperately, and I'll see you in the next video. Hugs and kisses. Bye-bye.",

      "content": "Apparently, consumer interest in extraction shooters ranks among the lowest. So, why do developers keep making them? Let's talk about it. So, there's a lot of chat about extraction shooters lately. Obviously, we have all the stuff happening with Marathon. Maybe not good stuff happening with Marathon, but we've also got excessive arc raiders. They just had the service land last weekend. And then the other day, Matt Piscatella, who works at Sakana, what's he up to now? What's he saying? He posted on Blue Sky, \"What's funny is that overall consumer interest in extraction shooters rates among the lowest across genres. And yet, why are devs so infatuated with this particular space? It's baffling. Is it a game maker's favorite kind of game?\" That is very surprising. I thought extraction shooters would be pretty high in terms of interest. If extraction shooters are a game maker's favorite kind of game in the same way that immersive sims are a game journalist's favorite kind of game. Oh yeah, that's a good way to look at it. Dishonored enjoyers are here. We had uh Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins came into the studio to talk a little bit about why people are making Yeah. I mean came in to talk about Arc, but then we were like, why do people keep making this? And he was like, first of all, relax. Second of all, let me explain to you why. So, we'll kick off with this quote from him cuz we asked about why Embark, you know, released the finals, working on the finals, also decided to get into the extraction shooter space. And uh turns out it was all thanks to a little pivot. Take it away, Virgil. The main factor that led to the pivot itself was the fact that we just couldn't get a game mode together that was repeatably fun. We had a lot of very interesting tech going into our enemies and like amazing art and and world building going into it, but the way the sessions were structured, you'd have fun maybe one out of 10 times. You knew you had to go kill a giant robot and that was cool, but there was nothing for you to do in between. So he tried more structured things like a mode where you went into an area and did objectives and then the giant boss would arrive or a mode where you were defending one of the outposts and it was kind of like a wave-based thing. And those were better, provided more structure, but again it lacked um a reason for you to ever repeat that because most of the the game lacked any sort of meta to it. You didn't have what we have today where you go back home and craft or do things or expand your your way of play. So, we just kept coming back to the fact that while it offered a novel experience, there was nothing to keep you coming back to it. You'd go, \"That was fun, but why?\" We had just done like a test, a public test, limited at the time. And saw the results from that and and the direction group at the time kind of went away and we had our big summer party and we're celebrating a good test and come back and they're like, \"Well, we're changing everything.\" Um, but it it honestly was for the better. Like I think a lot of us were unsure or or even skeptical of how we would ship what that game was trying to be. And certainly for us being such a small team relative to the amount of content that type of game implies, it really wasn't a good prospect for us to to make enough stuff that players would keep playing for that many hours. I think it really just made sense to move forward with the plans for PvE as a thing and then start shaping our game around that and then the meta that comes with it. So, how could we take the tension and the risk and the stories that come out of extraction games and put that into the world we've created and utilize all the learnings and PVE elements that we had to to make that into something from the outside looking in when I think about extraction shooters is something like a talk of doesn't feel very approachable to me and I feel like marathon certainly yes this is more approachable to me maybe in terms of the ease at which I guess you would kind of get in and like it didn't seem as daunting dealing with this this this and And so we talked to Virgil because you are not only competing with other games, you're competing against people's time. And so you want to make that on-ramp as easy as possible. So here's what he had to say about approachability. Very early it was trying to figure out in the metagame layer how we could kind of sand off some of those rough edges. You get in situations where you've lost a few rounds and now you have nothing left. and we wanted to just offer a a kit of gear to people straight away. So, we have a free load out that you can take at any time. There's no strings attached, but it's pretty limited in its capability. We still wanted you to have a minimally viable way to always play the game as intended. And then we also added kind of what we just call safety nets. So, one you might be familiar with is the the rooster that gives you materials to provide economic safety net for players. If you're not succeeding a lot, we still wanted you to progress incrementally and have a few materials on hand so you could craft like the gun you want to use or a piece of like gear or something like that. And then on top of that, it was adding a lot of ways to progress without succeeding. Do a quest, get some XP, finish a challenge, something. So these things carry with you even if you don't extract at the end of a round. I think the thing that really happens with extraction shooters is there's the story part of it. There is the starting hopefully ending with taking a big sack full of loot, you know, escaping by the skin of your teeth. The stories that we would play, like we're playing Overwatch or Call of Duty would be the stories of crap that we would say as friends, like fun bits. It would never be a specific moment in a game really. Whereas in Inraction shooters, it's like, \"Oh, do you remember when I got downed and then this and then I had this and you know, leaving that kind of thing.\" the kind of metrics that you use to judge whether you're having fun or being successful feel way more varied, diverse, and a little more forgiving on the extraction shooter side compared to battle royals and standard multiplayer games as well. You know, your kill death ratio, how you're contributing, but in an extraction shooter, it could be as simple as I didn't kill anyone, but I managed to get out with a new weapon. Yeah. So, it's not as contingent on you being super sharp with a mouse or a keyboard or or your controller and nailing head shot, which I think means, as you said, the barrier to entry and approachability is much better. So, you can do a bunch of different things. It's the same way that when we played Overwatch, it was like sometimes when you weren't having a great uh kind of session, you'd be like, I'm going to heal and I will be in the back holding M1 skillfree. Exactly. That means that even if you're not performing super well, you have a story to tell. you have you're contributing in a way that is still significant and I think that's something that extraction shooters get really really right even amongst the complexities of an extraction shooter design economy etc etc so arc raiders is out next week and it is very strange seeing the story of Arc Raiders versus the story of Marathon I don't want to certainly be kicking them while they're down want games to succeed here we actually spoke to Virgil a little bit not to you know dig or anything but to get his perspective on that comparison that's being made Like obviously there are a lot more extraction shooters. It's a much more invogue game mode. Yeah. But we were interested. It's like what's it like to watch when everything's going right for you but not necessarily going right someone else or someone else. I mean any outside information and that we can get is always great. So if if someone else can take a leap and maybe not succeed at it or or do and then have to reshape some other elements around it. I think that's good information to have. It was interesting during our tech test two to have them, you know, alongside us there and and kind of it was a very good sort of AB test almost of like things that we had opted not to do or had opted to do and how that kind of shook out. So certainly it's um good for contrast. I suppose the thing that I wrote about in my preview and we talked about is the game overall marathon. It didn't feel like it had something new to provide in the genre. And in the extraction shooter world, it's something that players can pick up on way more acutely than pretty much any other genre. And that's something I definitely picked up when I was playing it. I was like, \"Okay, this is a game that feels like it's ticking the extraction shoot boxes, but it doesn't understand or aspire to create the kind of magic that keeps that all that stuff together.\" for a game like Ark and for Marathon, they're also trying to convince people that all the time and money and, you know, effort they've invested in an existing extraction shooter should be left behind for a new one. And that is a tricky thing to do because you need a real unique idea. You need a hook of your own, but also you can't stray too far from what that core experience is, which is really, really tricky. And that is something we asked Virgil about. How do you strike that balance? and you know what is the key challenge for a new extraction shooter that you're facing and you know what Marathon is facing and no doubt what other extraction shooters will face. We've gone through internal iterations where we've had mechanics and then remove them even if the mechanic itself was pretty solid or fun. It did not make sense in the context of the whole game as I mentioned with things like uh our safety nets in the game. So free loadouts and and stuff. Other games have um like insurance systems for example to get some of your gear back and we tried stuff like that. It just really didn't seem to fit or it would have had to be been shoehorned in so much that we just kind of went for an alternate approach that ideally at the end achieves the same result but works inside of what our ecosystem is. So why do you think developers are so infatuated with extraction shoes? Do you think it's a boardroom decision? They see the success of things like hunt and tarov and are like hey we want to get into that. So Evan from PC Gamer replied to Matt's uh kind of statement. Extraction shooters are an evolution of an evolution and that's where a lot of like novel interesting new ideas stand and I think when you look at it from that perspective it can read as developers are interested in it because it does have that space within where you can be novel and create new ideas. You can have moments within moments. Yeah. The problem is you with meta progression on top of those moments. Exactly. If it's a evolution of evolution and the original starting point is something that you know is a success that being a first person shooter, you know that you're on a pathway which if you can get enough right, you have an inbuilt interesting audience already because people play shooters, you know. All right, thank you for watching another episode of Spoton. We'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Uh, in the meantime, you can find us here on GameSpot or Tam, you're at I'm tomorh.com on Blue Sky and to H everywhere else. I'm Lucy James Games everywhere. So, we will see you in a couple weeks. Thanks for watching. Bye. Apparently, consumer interest in extraction shooters ranks among the lowest. So, why do developers keep making them? Let's talk about it.

Dishonored enjoyers are here. We had uh Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins came into the studio to talk a little bit about why people are making Yeah. I mean came in to talk about Arc, but then we were like, why do people keep making this? And he was like, first of all, relax. Second of all, let me explain to you why. So, we'll kick off with this quote from him cuz we asked about why Embark, you know, released the finals, working on the finals, also decided to get into the extraction shooter space. And uh turns out it was all thanks to a little pivot. Take it away, Virgil. The main factor that led to the pivot itself was the fact that we just couldn't get a game mode together that was repeatably fun. We had a lot of very interesting tech going into our enemies and like amazing art and and world building going into it, but the way the sessions were structured, you'd have fun maybe one out of 10 times. You knew you had to go kill a giant robot and that was cool, but there was nothing for you to do in between. So he tried more structured things like a mode where you went into an area and did objectives and then the giant boss would arrive or a mode where you were defending one of the outposts and it was kind of like a wave-based thing. And those were better, provided more structure, but again it lacked um a reason for you to ever repeat that because most of the the game lacked any sort of meta to it. You didn't have what we have today where you go back home and craft or do things or expand your your way of play. So, we just kept coming back to the fact that while it offered a novel experience, there was nothing to keep you coming back to it. You'd go, \"That was fun, but why?\" We had just done like a test, a public test, limited at the time. And saw the results from that and and the direction group at the time kind of went away and we had our big summer party and we're celebrating a good test and come back and they're like, \"Well, we're changing everything.\" Um, but it it honestly was for the better. Like I think a lot of us were unsure or or even skeptical of how we would ship what that game was trying to be. And certainly for us being such a small team relative to the amount of content that type of game implies, it really wasn't a good prospect for us to to make enough stuff that players would keep playing for that many hours. I think it really just made sense to move forward with the plans for PvE as a thing and then start shaping our game around that and then the meta that comes with it. So, how could we take the tension and the risk and the stories that come out of extraction games and put that into the world we've created and utilize all the learnings and PVE elements that we had to to make that into something from the outside looking in when I think about extraction shooters is something like a talk of doesn't feel very approachable to me and I feel like marathon certainly yes this is more approachable to me maybe in terms of the ease at which I guess you would kind of get in and like it didn't seem as daunting dealing with this this this and And so we talked to Virgil because you are not only competing with other games, you're competing against people's time. And so you want to make that on-ramp as easy as possible. So here's what he had to say about approachability. Very early it was trying to figure out in the metagame layer how we could kind of sand off some of those rough edges. You get in situations where you've lost a few rounds and now you have nothing left. and we wanted to just offer a a kit of gear to people straight away. So, we have a free load out that you can take at any time. There's no strings attached, but it's pretty limited in its capability. We still wanted you to have a minimally viable way to always play the game as intended. And then we also added kind of what we just call safety nets. So, one you might be familiar with is the the rooster that gives you materials to provide economic safety net for players. If you're not succeeding a lot, we still wanted you to progress incrementally and have a few materials on hand so you could craft like the gun you want to use or a piece of like gear or something like that. And then on top of that, it was adding a lot of ways to progress without succeeding. Do a quest, get some XP, finish a challenge, something. So these things carry with you even if you don't extract at the end of a round. I think the thing that really happens with extraction shooters is there's the story part of it. There is the starting hopefully ending with taking a big sack full of loot, you know, escaping by the skin of your teeth. The stories that we would play, like we're playing Overwatch or Call of Duty would be the stories of crap that we would say as friends, like fun bits. It would never be a specific moment in a game really. Whereas in Inraction shooters, it's like, \"Oh, do you remember when I got downed and then this and then I had this and you know, leaving that kind of thing.\" the kind of metrics that you use to judge whether you're having fun or being successful feel way more varied, diverse, and a little more forgiving on the extraction shooter side compared to battle royals and standard multiplayer games as well. You know, your kill death ratio, how you're contributing, but in an extraction shooter, it could be as simple as I didn't kill anyone, but I managed to get out with a new weapon. Yeah. So, it's not as contingent on you being super sharp with a mouse or a keyboard or or your controller and nailing head shot, which I think means, as you said, the barrier to entry and approachability is much better. So, you can do a bunch of different things. It's the same way that when we played Overwatch, it was like sometimes when you weren't having a great uh kind of session, you'd be like, I'm going to heal and I will be in the back holding M1 skillfree. Exactly. That means that even if you're not performing super well, you have a story to tell. you have you're contributing in a way that is still significant and I think that's something that extraction shooters get really really right even amongst the complexities of an extraction shooter design economy etc etc so arc raiders is out next week and it is very strange seeing the story of Arc Raiders versus the story of Marathon I don't want to certainly be kicking them while they're down want games to succeed here we actually spoke to Virgil a little bit not to you know dig or anything but to get his perspective on that comparison that's being made Like obviously there are a lot more extraction shooters. It's a much more invogue game mode. Yeah. But we were interested. It's like what's it like to watch when everything's going right for you but not necessarily going right someone else or someone else. I mean any outside information and that we can get is always great. So if if someone else can take a leap and maybe not succeed at it or or do and then have to reshape some other elements around it. I think that's good information to have. It was interesting during our tech test two to have them, you know, alongside us there and and kind of it was a very good sort of AB test almost of like things that we had opted not to do or had opted to do and how that kind of shook out. So certainly it's um good for contrast. I suppose the thing that I wrote about in my preview and we talked about is the game overall marathon. It didn't feel like it had something new to provide in the genre. And in the extraction shooter world, it's something that players can pick up on way more acutely than pretty much any other genre. And that's something I definitely picked up when I was playing it. I was like, \"Okay, this is a game that feels like it's ticking the extraction shoot boxes, but it doesn't understand or aspire to create the kind of magic that keeps that all that stuff together.\" for a game like Ark and for Marathon, they're also trying to convince people that all the time and money and, you know, effort they've invested in an existing extraction shooter should be left behind for a new one. And that is a tricky thing to do because you need a real unique idea. You need a hook of your own, but also you can't stray too far from what that core experience is, which is really, really tricky. And that is something we asked Virgil about. How do you strike that balance? and you know what is the key challenge for a new extraction shooter that you're facing and you know what Marathon is facing and no doubt what other extraction shooters will face. We've gone through internal iterations where we've had mechanics and then remove them even if the mechanic itself was pretty solid or fun. It did not make sense in the context of the whole game as I mentioned with things like uh our safety nets in the game. So free loadouts and and stuff. Other games have um like insurance systems for example to get some of your gear back and we tried stuff like that. It just really didn't seem to fit or it would have had to be been shoehorned in so much that we just kind of went for an alternate approach that ideally at the end achieves the same result but works inside of what our ecosystem is. So why do you think developers are so infatuated with extraction shoes? Do you think it's a boardroom decision? They see the success of things like hunt and tarov and are like hey we want to get into that. So Evan from PC Gamer replied to Matt's uh kind of statement. Extraction shooters are an evolution of an evolution and that's where a lot of like novel interesting new ideas stand and I think when you look at it from that perspective it can read as developers are interested in it because it does have that space within where you can be novel and create new ideas. You can have moments within moments. Yeah. The problem is you with meta progression on top of those moments. Exactly. If it's a evolution of evolution and the original starting point is something that you know is a success that being a first person shooter, you know that you're on a pathway which if you can get enough right, you have an inbuilt interesting audience already because people play shooters, you know. All right, thank you for watching another episode of Spoton. We'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Uh, in the meantime, you can find us here on GameSpot or Tam, you're at I'm tomorh.com on Blue Sky and to H everywhere else. I'm Lucy James Games everywhere. So, we will see you in a couple weeks.

      "content": "I tried six single player extraction shooters with one goal in mind. To find the most immersive and engaging experience you can enjoy on your own. And when I say single player, I'm talking you versus the game. No one else involved. No human friends nor human enemies. After each game, I'll rate it out of five stars. Starting with Escape from Tarov, the PVE zone. In July of 2024, Battlestate Games released the PvE zone. It's basically Tarov without humans as enemies. All opponents are replaced with AI. You could co-op with friends, but in our case, we're going completely solo. And with over 6,000 hours clocked into Tarov PvP myself, I was genuinely curious to experience if the PvE zone can provide the same immersive and engaging fun the base PVP mode brings. I had my doubts though, unsure of how challenging AI could be. But in my first raid ever in Tarov PvE, this happened. immediately humbled by AI less than 5 minutes into my first game. So, I came back for another one. This time with full respect of what my opponents can bring to the table. What? That was a dual PMC. What the What was going on, dude? That was a dual PMC and I got spotted and I'm stuck. I'm getting pushed by someone else. Oh, I got another guy to my right. I can't even see this. Okay, there's a guy to my left and guy to my right. Need to try to aggro this guy in the right. Oh, there he is. I'm not sure if that was a PMC or a Scav. The dual's pushing me. Oh my god. What? What is up with that duo? These these guys actually legit scare me. They are legit scaring me. Someone to my left as well. I'm stuck in this freaking spawn, dude. Someone's walking to my left. He's about to come out. Just walked past me. This is crazy. None of them are fighting, too. It's me against the world chat. Oh, shoot. They're just looking at me. They're looking at me. They're just looking at me. I think I dropped one. I can't see him behind the fence. Did I drop any of them? What am I doing here? Can I get out of here? There's no door. I don't remember. There's no door here, right? This is crazy. I'm pinched right out of spawn. I can barely see them through that fence. There's walking to my left and to my right and none of them none of them are fighting. Yeah, I do have nades. The thing is like I just got to get rid of them. If I nade them, they just they just displace, right? I didn't kill any of them. Oh, I got one. I got I see one dead body right there. Can't open that door right there. We heard movement to the left. Okay, it's a it's a bare PMC to my left. So, we got to be careful with that dude. I don't know where this guy is. So, we did drop one. The other PMC though is still alive. I have no idea where he is. So, I have cover to my left, which is good. We heard him. He's close, right? He's behind his SUV. Okay, so we have to get rid of the guy on the right. Guy to my left just holding me as well. I guess we could grenade this guy here. Oh my god, dude. I have no idea where that was from. Dude, what is going on here? Actual horror game, chat. Oh, he's right here. He's going to push. He's pushing my heal. He's pushing my heal. That guy's dead. I've never been stuck in this corner for so long in my whole Tarov life. Okay, so it seems like right side's clear. There's a PMC in the left side earlier who's holding me. I'm trying to figure out how I can maybe I can grenade this dude out of the way. I think I might have just grenaded myself. Yeah, it I hit the freaking top. So, a bunch of dead PMC. I do want to loot these guys. Man, I swear if I start looting, I'm going to get shot. I feel it. Do I leave this guy chat? He looks chill. Dealing with PV is no joke. Super fine. Super fine. I don't want his dog tag to be fair. We're super super chill. Very chill right now. What is this? PS rounds. Yeah. Yeah, it's PS. We drop this mag. As like a first timer in PvE, I'm still trying to gauge the AI and it's very scary gauging them right now, chat. I will not lie. This guy is juiced. He's high level 17. This guy is gaming. This guy doesn't He's He's no life in touch grass. Level 17 gamer. Okay, we're good. That leaves no lifing. 15 minutes in and I've moved 10 m. After successfully clearing my immediate area and looting every drop of gear, I finally made it out of my spawn. Got out of this basement area and into the surface level, hoping to safely make my way to a nearby office to grab a hard drive for a quest. My goal for each single player extraction shooter is to finish at least one quest before allowing myself to move on to the next game. So, I carefully cleared my corners, grabbed the quest key from a nearby dead scientist, slowly made my way up to the offices, unlocked the door, grabbed my quest item, and sweatily but safely made it to extract. That was pretty sweaty. I like that experience. That was cool. Tarov PvE exceeded my expectations. I was immersed and completely engaged. The only downside is it's pricey cuz you'll need to buy the base game at $50, then buy the PV expansion for another 20, making it a $70 investment, which can be a big ask. But for one of the best extraction shooter experiences you can get out there, it might be worth your hard-earned money. Four out of five stars. Sweaty but expensive. Next up, another tactical PVE only extraction shooter that again, like Tarov PvE, you can either play solo or with friends. This is Incursion Red River. I actually had the chance to play this nearly a year ago for another video, but at the time I wasn't a huge fan of PvE extraction shooters. So, I was pretty critical about this game. But as the genre continues to evolve, I've come to appreciate why PvE extraction shooters exist. Not everyone wants the stress of PvP or the frustration of dealing with cheaters, both of which have ruined the experience of PvP extraction shooters for many. With that in mind, I returned to this game with a fresh perspective, approaching this session with intention, ready to fully immerse myself in the world of Incursion Red River. And it wasn't hard to do that cuz this game is absolutely gorgeous. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it takes advantage of how much you can push the engine visually. All right, we got the 74M with a flashlight. We put a a B10M on this and a foregrip. I don't remember what for grip we put. Let's go single fire. Oh, I pressed BB. Seems to be holster. So that's semi x. I'm going to go semi for now. Let's uh sorry. Oh, reload night vision. Okay, I like this. This is pressing M actually brought this out. Mag check. Hold R. Emergency reload. Drops mag double R. Normal reload. Let's do a mag check. Just see how it looks. Okay, that's a mag check. Cool. Flashlight. Uh four is the is the map thing, right? There we go. Secure intel. So, I accepted a quest to secure a document and delivered to a marked dropbox on the other side of the map. With my objective clear, I set out on the hunt. The g the movement feels really good. It actually feels good. Especially like you know how like most of our games that are like Tarov are so freaking clunky, Tarov included, the movement can get clunky. This one feels pretty smooth. They didn't go for the uh mega clunky realism kind of thing. It's more of accessible feeling. I was prepared. Feels actually pretty good. But not probably behind that wall there. Okay, hold up. Hold up. I don't know where I am. I'm going to walk here. So, what I can imagine based on like the feel so far, dude, where was that voice? That dude sounded like he was above me. He's not above me. Is what I what I can imagine here is this is definitely a game that I feel you could just be immersive with your friends with. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm right. Going up here. The other's board, too. He must be up here, cuz he sounded like he was right above me earlier, but he's not. Sector clear. Moving the next sector. Taking fire. Need assistance. Probably not a head shot. Voice voice acting is pretty good. Can I jump here? Let's hug this red wall. Damn, the game looks really good. Okay. Uh, one thing I want to check. Let's go check how how magp packing works. Or is it instapac like um Oops. I keep pressing I. Okay. Currently instack, which is fine. Just wondering. It's like placeholder for now, I assume. Okay, let's loot. Hold F to loot. Ooh, that looks nice. A saw and painkillers. We take those. That aug looked pretty nice. Let's inspect. I to inspect. Let's go try this. Okay, I got to keep checking the map. I am just 100% lost right now. Okay, so you can see the other mark on the base. Okay, that's what I was looking for. There's a white box marker south of you at the map. Yeah, so this is this is the one we were looking at, right? Or are you talking about further south? So I'm looking for the other marker. Or is this the is this the only marker? Is there any other marker that I'm where I'm supposed to grab the thing? You can see the other mark on the base. Oh, dude. I did not see that. That was Okay, I get it now. I get it, dude. It was so camouflaged. It was pretty camouflaged, not going to lie. Okay. Well, there's a dude right there. Do I I don't think I want to shoot now. Um I'm like in a weird spot. I don't even have range. Security move. All right, dude. I'm going to hug that container. So, our objective is somewhere here. Wait, we saw the dude up here rather. So, let's not let's be careful of that. I hear footsteps next to me. I can't tell if he's actually here. Activity reported. Proceed with caution. Oh, take cover. Someone's close left here on the corner. I remember seeing someone up there. Was that the building with the stairs? the Oh my goodness. There's someone here. This AUG hits feels like it hits harder than my AK because the bullets are better slightly. Felt like earlier my AK was just they were just tanking my AK bullets. This has I think um a little more pen. [Music] Hold up. That guy didn't shoot me the whole time. Oh. [Music] He was hiding behind cover. You see his animation chat? He's hiding behind cover, but there was a window. But um yeah, cheat to that guy. One thing I'm um starting to like learn about these types of games is that um I always felt like every tactical shooter has to be very challenging to be fun. And then in the recent Oh my god, dude. He hit me. I've realized that sometimes just an immersive experience, even if it's not like crazy hardcore, is just a good time, too. Pick up item. Oh, it's my it's my quest. I just realized. Okay, that's the quest. Now, we got to take that to the to the compound earlier. Let's go check the tower if um if that dude has like a sniper scope. Oh, is that a foul? No scope on him, but is that a foul? Oh, boy. All right, let's get rid of that MP5. Wait, wait, wait. just just so we can see how the MP5 [Music] shoots. Okay, cool. We know how that works. Let's check out the [Music] foul. You're that MP5 rounders, too, is insane. What's the bullet on this? M80s penetration 22 damage 90ation level three. Uh, the F looks fun. I need a sight on this. See how this sounds. I was hoping that would sound beefier. Oh shoot. Holy. That suppression mechanic is pretty cool. straighter than you. See if we get a flank on this. How's flanking AI? Do they like see me through walls flanking kind of thing? Oh, they don't. That's pretty cool. Okay, little sketchy. Oh, I kind of remember this place. I've been here before. Okay, that was a lot of voices. We got a lot of gamers chat. I don't know where they are though. Mag check. We're close. We're about to get get uh lose lose it all. Nope. Tab. Um going to put this down here front. Whatever. Put that up there. We'll lose the mag. It's cool. Okay. So, I'm near it to my left. Oh, this is it. This is it. How do I know if if this is the right one? Is there like a notification or something? Nope. Yeah. Placed intel. Check mark. Perfect. So, that was the right one. Survive an extract from the area. Um okay. Okay, so our nearest X track's right here. It's open. Does not close. Another extract right here. That's too far. Opens in 2 minutes. Too far. Opens in 36 seconds. All right. So, just directly. We just got to fight our way out, I guess, to the west directly. Enemy spotted. Engage. Oh my goodness. That's what I heard the whole time. See what loot this has to offer cuz why not? Ooh, I was looking for that the whole time. You found one at the end of the raid, though. Let's see how this works. How do I How do I go zoom in? Zoom out. Middle mouse. Oh, toggle. Oh, so you hold middle mouse and then you scroll up. I mean, no, no, not scroll up. You move your mouse up and then Okay. All right, extract a nine. Eight. That was a That was a solid raid. Overall, a solid experience. Game definitely needs a lot of time to cook. And I'd love to see the AI to be more engaging in the future. Something like AI squads zoning in on my position as I shoot really loud guns, forcing me to want to run a suppressor for the extra tacticalness. But for only $1699, it could be a fun tactical Barbie game you could keep in your library. Three stars. Game looks amazing, but needs time to cook. This next game is one of the more highly requested games my community has asked me to check out in the last handful of months. And this video is the perfect excuse to finally check it out. It's called Hole, a single player extraction shooter for only $4.99 that looks like a game straight out of the late '90s. And this game does not hold your hand. It throws you straight in and you got to figure things out yourself. Okay, so I guess we just Oh, reload. Ooh, it it told me to mouse. Okay, microwave turn off. Wee. So, that's the extract mechanic of this game. Return home office level. Enter. Let's just go. Let's go with it. I think I have infinite ammo. Uh, I actually have no idea what I'm doing. Well, well, we're playing blind. Whatever. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's It's an extraction shooter, so I guess we just loot and figure it out as we go. The the lean gives me a little motion sickness. It's a It's a very intense lean. There's a little motion sickness involved with it for me. Or maybe I'm getting old. Whoa. Holy loot. Wait, what do I do with all this dopamine chat? Oh my god. Best game ever. Oh shoot. Okay. Okay. Reloading. Oh. Oh. Oh, you have to. Okay. The slide. I was aiming too high. Okay. Reload. And then after this chat, you got to boom. Oh, got them both. Nice. Yeah, that lean is is very intense. It's throwing me off a little bit, but okay. Money. Money is always nice. Got to grab all the money. I want to lean, but at the same time, There we go. So, always remember, mouse click. Oh, he went back to cover. That's cool. Okay, so what's important with these with these extra single player experiences is just fun AI. That was nice. That was a nice sign. So, there's a number in the bottom left that's that's continuously rising. I don't know what that is. I also don't know what I'm looting for. Okay, open that. Dude, are these SD cards or something? What is this? I don't even know what this is, but I'll take anything. That is the AI gear level. They get scarier over time. Oh, so the longer I stay, the harder they get, which kind of pushes me to to want to leave. Speaking of, he's got a Can I take a sniper? No, I don't think so. Right. I haven't Can I loot? No, I can't leave their body. No, I can't. So, what I understand as well is that AI fight each other. They're like different factions. All the AIs that look alike are friends. Maybe that's where we go. Yeah. See how they were fighting? Oh my god. Oh shoot. That was a shotgun and a half. Okay, it's getting a little more intense indeed. He's still alive. Oh, that made me sick. Oh, I just realized there's an overheat mechanic. Bottom right. Okay, I I only noticed that cuz my barrel was getting hot. All right, let's find an extract. I don't know how to extract. I I know the microwave is the extract. I don't know how to find it. Oh, here. It's extract. Let's get out of here. That was pretty fun. This game's interesting. Okay, so cash was Okay, cash was the coins. Data is the seven is the SD card looking thing. Uh, it also shows you how many of So again, each color is a different faction. We killed 14. There's four wave. We survived four waves time. Okay, retry. Let's go home first. Um, this is home. Okay. So, there's no main menu. Ooh. Okay. Ah, so build. What's the the the currency we got in game in raid? It's pretty. Okay. Okay. I see that. That is such a nice touch. Hello. What is this? Let's go talk to this show task card. Oh, okay. So, tasks. Okay. Can we accept all reward new key? I'm interested about this key. Oh, we can we can do all. Okay. So, five kill five of each. Okay. So, we go back and raid here. With my first set of quests in hand, I jumped in to eliminate five members from each AI faction. And the experience quickly got pretty intense. He's got a helmet. Since the AI difficulty increases the longer you stay in the raid, the game nails that extraction shooter adrenaline, but in a really simple, effective way. You can't linger too long or you'll start running into better geared enemies, so I had to move fast, complete my objectives, and extract before things got out of hand. It does get repetitive fairly quick, but the progression is what kept me going. Since I came into this with a blind playthrough, I was excited to see what I'd unlocked next on my base. And the biggest dopamine hit came when I completed a quest that rewarded me with a key. and I used this key to open a door and found a blue disc which once I returned home unlocked an AR-15. So that pulled me in deeper. I had to try it out even if I only had 10 round mags. My chat leader explained that the way to upgrade your weapons is to stay in the raid long enough for tougher enemies to spawn ones that drop mods. Never reached that point in my playthrough though, but it's a cool mechanic that encourages you to push your luck and stay engaged. One of my viewers summed it up perfectly. He said this might become his favorite lunch break game. Just a couple quick runs on his Steam Deck. Three and a half stars. For only $4.99, you can make lunch breaks fun again. Next is one of the most unique-l lookinging extraction shooters out there, but does it play as good as it looks? This is the Forever Winter. This is a game where you play as a scavenger. One of the narratives it tries to push is the idea that you are not the main character. Cuz when you're in raid, there's a whole war going down between three waring factions, Urusa, Europa, and Eurasia. And you are technically not part of the war. You're simply trying to make ends meet for yourself by scavenging valuables from the ongoing battles. And it's up to you how you navigate the world. Whether you decide to shoot everything on site or let the waring factions continue to fight and stay busy while you loot their scraps along the way. In today's mission though, Europa is offering me cash and gear to help them take down their Eurasian enemies. So, I accepted the offer since again I'm just trying to make ends meet here. Let's find some Eurasians. This is Europan Uruskan. So, we need 10 10 of these dudes. Europan as well. This has to be your Wait, no, that's your Ruskan. I'm looking for Eurasians. Whoops. Sorry, dude. That's Eurasian. Eurasian drone. There we go. That's uh six of 15. This is a Eurasian. Oh, well, they blew him up. All right. Thanks. This guy is Europan. We don't want that. This guy is your rusk gun. Not him either. Europan soldier. What are you fighting? Europan soldier. Europan soldier. They're all Europans. Don't get boxed in. They're probably fighting Eurasians right now. Let's go check them out. More radar. What are you guys? You're open as well. Reminds you of Gears of War. The the uh Yeah, the the point of view uh the third person definitely gives it that feel. And the the I guess the general art can give you a Gears of War feel as well. and the movement. I can see that. Okay, they all stopped fighting. Let's go to the other side of the map. Maybe we'll find more um box Eurasians on the other side. We only killed one so far. That's Europa. And who are they shooting? They're probably fighting a Eurasian. Is this I can't tag it. Hello. I I can't tell what what faction that is. Not that I want to fight a chopper, though. Look at that tank. Your rust gun still. It's Eurasian. I don't know if I want to fight a chopper though. Europan Ruskan Europan. Look for gaps. Maybe we can slip past. your Russ gun. Europan. Okay, so Europa and your Ruskan are definitely not friendly. They're fighting each other. Hold up. These are your Asians. Not going to lie, chat. I can't see what I'm shooting. I'm just uh Oh, no. I killed one, dude. I killed one in that whole army. I magnly killed one, dude. Uh, that's my kill. There we go. That's my kill. I thought I killed more than that there. Hey, leave me alone. Leave me alone. You guys stole my kills, dude. Leave me alone. Oh. Okay, we got two kills. I need I need seven more. So, you really want to watch your fire, Chad, and really uh pick your battles cuz you don't want to just shoot everything. That is a battle we don't want. Oh, that's that has to be Eurasian. Fight ahead, chat. The the the 50 cal is really slow. That's why we were whiffing our shots earlier. Look at that. Look how tough it is to Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, there we go. That felt satisfying. Holy crap. What is all this? Wait, these are Eurasian. These are Eurasian. Uhoh. Did I shoot an exo? I shot an exo. I didn't mean to shoot an exoskeleton. Those those uh those crawling cyborgs, that's all Eurasian. Oh my goodness, dude. Oh my goodness. I whiffed everything. Need four more. Come on. That's my killer right here. Right in front. Right in front. The reload takes forever. One more. Oh, right there. Come on. It's in between the legs of the exoskeleton. There we go. Let's get out of here. Completed. Call it the hero. Call the her. Call the herd, rather. I thought it said call the hero. Call the herd. That's the quest we just finished. GG. All right. Let's get out of here. So, you can theoretically run through the middle of all this fighting and uh no one's going to shoot you cuz they're too busy fighting each other. You can run and uh catch bullets though, so be careful with that. All right. GG G. Back in September of 2024, this game went viral within the extraction shooter community for doing something completely different. While most titles in the genre focus on wiping out lobbies and grabbing as much loot as possible, The Forever Winter encouraged players to pick their battles and scavenge only what they needed. It's quite a polarizing game and still is, especially since it's still very early in development. At $29.99 for an unfinished game, it definitely took some heat. Three stars. A unique take, but far from developed. Next up, Escape from Duck. Yeah, you heard that right. Tarov, but ducks. The game begins with a classic tutorial showing how movement, looting, and combat works. Oh my god, dude. Wait, wait, wait. This is actually way more satisfying than I thought it would be. Loot. Ooh, our first gun. Oh, this game is way more morbid than I thought it'd be, too. Oh, chilling. We're chilling. Okay. Yeah, that kind of hurt. It then leads us to our first extract, bringing me into my hat out where it shows me that I can upgrade both my base and my character using different materials found in Raid, and of course, some money. So, this game's got all the fundamentals of a Tarov like extraction shooter. But the question is, does it play well? I went out into the world to explore and feel out the duck combat, and along the way, I found a random house. Wait, is this guy Is this an NPC or is this an enemy? Hello? Are we friends? Who is that? Oh my god, he's got abs on him. He's jacked. Here muscles, they're gifted. How about some sastic training with me? These trainings will not only strengthen your body but also enlighten your mind. Come here. I Your master is going to assign your first challenge, dude. All right. He is a thick duck indeed. What is the first challenge quest? Oh, he's got Okay. Submit eggs. Two eggs. Satisfy the protein needs of the muscular doug. The most important aspect to concern. My first challenge is find two eggs for me. Find while doing squat walks. Go. Remember, selfless makes you free. Dude, I Whoever made this game, dude, too lazy to sit. The devs have a good sense of humor. This is good. This is good. I remember that back in my hideout, there's a vending machine where I can buy eggs. So, I decided to head home to grab some for this jack duck. But trying to get home was an adventure in itself. Oh, I was about to shoot my own pet. Okay. Okay. I was trying to see chat if I could uh if I could bait him into shooting and then I just dodged, but that's not working, dude. Okay, this guy is Can my pet please bite him or something? Okay, so you really got to got to peek him and then just um Oh, medium bullets. Don't want to hurt. You got to Oh, shoot. Oh my god. Why is everyone so juiced out of nowhere? Okay. Okay. We're We're into deep chat. We got to get home. I'm out of meds. Okay. What's the nearest extract? These guys are so juicy now. Out of nowhere. So, I got to peek and and and like mag dump. It's the It's the way. I am so hurt, though. I just realized I'm not using my my pet. I got to put stuff in my my my uh pets bag. Like, I don't know. Yarn. Put it there. Shoot. I I need to get home. Let's put the better bullets. I'm going to get dropped, dude. I never knew I'd be playing very slow and escape from Duckov. I'll be honest. Out of nowhere, this got super sweaty out of nowhere. Do that later. Oh, shoot. There's a dude in here. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm on HP. I'm on HP. Oh [ __ ] Oh my god. Oh my god. I have one tree. Oh my god, dude. One HP in a dream joy. Loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I think I should just go home. Loot. Oh my god. Let's get out of here. Oh my god. I survived with one HP. Let's get out of here, boys. All right. Welcome back. Jeez, dude. That was sweat. Barely surviving. I grabbed the two eggs at home and brought it back to the muscular duck, successfully finishing my first ever quest in Escape from Duck Offov. I then unintentionally ended up playing for about another hour, not realizing how much more fun I was having than I thought. For what it is, the game is actually pretty fun. It's currently free on Steam, but only a demo is available. No word on how much the game's going to be yet, and it plans to fully release sometime in 2025. Three and a half stars. If you can get past the fact that you're a duck, it can get addictive. And last, but definitely not the least, Zero Severt. I didn't think I'd like this game initially because of the visuals, but I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. It starts like your usual hardcore survival or extraction shooter where it does not hold your hand. You're meant to slowly discover things on your own by interacting with the world and talking to strangers. So, I spoke to this bartender who gave me full context of where I am. We're in Zero Severt, the only safe place in Zach, the city we're currently standing on that was destroyed by a huge nuclear power plant explosion. And from there, we got to figure everything else out ourselves as I was tasked to kill five wolves and in return, money and some gear from the bartender. So, I set out on my first adventure ever in the city of Zach. One thing to note is the difficulty of the game is highly customizable. I'm currently playing on the default medium difficulty of the game called Survivor. In this mode, if I die, I return back in time to the moment before we left the base, still with all my gear. At higher difficulties, you can set it to where you lose all your gear, like Tarov or even a perma death mode. But for this session, as I still try to learn the ins and outs of zero sever, I'm playing on its standard survivor mode. So, we're looking for five wolves. Oh my god. Okay, that hurt. Okay. Okay. All right. Where was his body? Oh my goodness. Oh, there it is. Ketter. Durability 50. Is it better than mine? Is it worth keeping, dude? This guy. What the was that? He's getting so much stuff on him. Bad water though. Screw nut. I guess sounds useful. Tea bag. There's so much stuff. This is again it's like Tarov all over again. Like what the hell is all this? But um this is heavy indeed. I'll move slower. I'll just drop stuff if I don't know what the what they do. Um, what is why is my not thirsty, not hungry, well-rested, not irrit Okay, I think what I want to do for now is I'm going to hover closer to my extract and see if I could farm wolves near my extract. Oh, those are bores. Hold up. Hold up. With my first death in this game, I knew that the only way to learn this game was the hard way. And I was all in. Oh my god, dude. Oh my god. You freaking extract camper. There's no way. Death after death, I gain a little more confidence and already I felt the addiction pulling me in. I started feeling it, understanding the flow of the game as I finished my first quest. And if you're wondering how I feel about this game after my first task, well, I've been playing this game a lot when I take little breaks from editing this video. Literally every break I get to catch, I'm on zero sever. I'm absolutely loving this game and I'm looking forward to doing a perma death run one day. But for now, it's a lot of learning the hard way. Five stars. Don't let the visuals fool you. Best game ever. These single player extraction shooters are a good chill time. But if you want to squeeze in some PvP, you might want to try one of these games from this video right here. Thank you to our patrons.

I tried six single player extraction shooters with one goal in mind. To find the most immersive and engaging experience you can enjoy on your own. And when I say single player, I'm talking you versus the game. No one else involved. No human friends nor human enemies. After each game, I'll rate it out of five stars. Starting with Escape from Tarov, the PVE zone. In July of 2024, Battlestate Games released the PvE zone. It's basically Tarov without humans as enemies. All opponents are replaced with AI. You could co-op with friends, but in our case, we're going completely solo. And with over 6,000 hours clocked into Tarov PvP myself, I was genuinely curious to experience if the PvE zone can provide the same immersive and engaging fun the base PVP mode brings. I had my doubts though, unsure of how challenging AI could be. But in my first raid ever in Tarov PvE, this happened. immediately humbled by AI less than 5 minutes into my first game. So, I came back for another one. This time with full respect of what my opponents can bring to the table. What? That was a dual PMC. What the What was going on, dude? That was a dual PMC and I got spotted and I'm stuck. I'm getting pushed by someone else. Oh, I got another guy to my right. I can't even see this. Okay, there's a guy to my left and guy to my right. Need to try to aggro this guy in the right. Oh, there he is. I'm not sure if that was a PMC or a Scav. The dual's pushing me. Oh my god. What? What is up with that duo? These these guys actually legit scare me. They are legit scaring me. Someone to my left as well. I'm stuck in this freaking spawn, dude. Someone's walking to my left. He's about to come out. Just walked past me. This is crazy. None of them are fighting, too. It's me against the world chat. Oh, shoot. They're just looking at me. They're looking at me. They're just looking at me. I think I dropped one. I can't see him behind the fence. Did I drop any of them? What am I doing here? Can I get out of here? There's no door. I don't remember. There's no door here, right? This is crazy. I'm pinched right out of spawn. I can barely see them through that fence. There's walking to my left and to my right and none of them none of them are fighting. Yeah, I do have nades. The thing is like I just got to get rid of them. If I nade them, they just they just displace, right? I didn't kill any of them. Oh, I got one. I got I see one dead body right there. Can't open that door right there. We heard movement to the left. Okay, it's a it's a bare PMC to my left. So, we got to be careful with that dude. I don't know where this guy is. So, we did drop one. The other PMC though is still alive. I have no idea where he is. So, I have cover to my left, which is good. We heard him. He's close, right? He's behind his SUV. Okay, so we have to get rid of the guy on the right. Guy to my left just holding me as well. I guess we could grenade this guy here. Oh my god, dude. I have no idea where that was from. Dude, what is going on here? Actual horror game, chat. Oh, he's right here. He's going to push. He's pushing my heal. He's pushing my heal. That guy's dead. I've never been stuck in this corner for so long in my whole Tarov life. Okay, so it seems like right side's clear. There's a PMC in the left side earlier who's holding me. I'm trying to figure out how I can maybe I can grenade this dude out of the way. I think I might have just grenaded myself. Yeah, it I hit the freaking top. So, a bunch of dead PMC. I do want to loot these guys. Man, I swear if I start looting, I'm going to get shot. I feel it. Do I leave this guy chat? He looks chill. Dealing with PV is no joke. Super fine. Super fine. I don't want his dog tag to be fair. We're super super chill. Very chill right now. What is this? PS rounds. Yeah. Yeah, it's PS. We drop this mag. As like a first timer in PvE, I'm still trying to gauge the AI and it's very scary gauging them right now, chat. I will not lie. This guy is juiced. He's high level 17. This guy is gaming. This guy doesn't He's He's no life in touch grass. Level 17 gamer. Okay, we're good. That leaves no lifing. 15 minutes in and I've moved 10 m. After successfully clearing my immediate area and looting every drop of gear, I finally made it out of my spawn. Got out of this basement area and into the surface level, hoping to safely make my way to a nearby office to grab a hard drive for a quest. My goal for each single player extraction shooter is to finish at least one quest before allowing myself to move on to the next game. So, I carefully cleared my corners, grabbed the quest key from a nearby dead scientist, slowly made my way up to the offices, unlocked the door, grabbed my quest item, and sweatily but safely made it to extract. That was pretty sweaty. I like that experience. That was cool. Tarov PvE exceeded my expectations. I was immersed and completely engaged. The only downside is it's pricey cuz you'll need to buy the base game at $50, then buy the PV expansion for another 20, making it a $70 investment, which can be a big ask. But for one of the best extraction shooter experiences you can get out there, it might be worth your hard-earned money. Four out of five stars. Sweaty but expensive. Next up, another tactical PVE only extraction shooter that again, like Tarov PvE, you can either play solo or with friends. This is Incursion Red River. I actually had the chance to play this nearly a year ago for another video, but at the time I wasn't a huge fan of PvE extraction shooters. So, I was pretty critical about this game. But as the genre continues to evolve, I've come to appreciate why PvE extraction shooters exist. Not everyone wants the stress of PvP or the frustration of dealing with cheaters, both of which have ruined the experience of PvP extraction shooters for many. With that in mind, I returned to this game with a fresh perspective, approaching this session with intention, ready to fully immerse myself in the world of Incursion Red River. And it wasn't hard to do that cuz this game is absolutely gorgeous. Built on Unreal Engine 5, it takes advantage of how much you can push the engine visually. All right, we got the 74M with a flashlight. We put a a B10M on this and a foregrip. I don't remember what for grip we put. Let's go single fire. Oh, I pressed BB. Seems to be holster. So that's semi x. I'm going to go semi for now. Let's uh sorry. Oh, reload night vision. Okay, I like this. This is pressing M actually brought this out. Mag check. Hold R. Emergency reload. Drops mag double R. Normal reload. Let's do a mag check. Just see how it looks. Okay, that's a mag check. Cool. Flashlight. Uh four is the is the map thing, right? There we go. Secure intel. So, I accepted a quest to secure a document and delivered to a marked dropbox on the other side of the map. With my objective clear, I set out on the hunt. The g the movement feels really good. It actually feels good. Especially like you know how like most of our games that are like Tarov are so freaking clunky, Tarov included, the movement can get clunky. This one feels pretty smooth. They didn't go for the uh mega clunky realism kind of thing. It's more of accessible feeling. I was prepared. Feels actually pretty good. But not probably behind that wall there. Okay, hold up. Hold up. I don't know where I am. I'm going to walk here. So, what I can imagine based on like the feel so far, dude, where was that voice? That dude sounded like he was above me. He's not above me. Is what I what I can imagine here is this is definitely a game that I feel you could just be immersive with your friends with. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm right. Going up here. The other's board, too. He must be up here, cuz he sounded like he was right above me earlier, but he's not. Sector clear. Moving the next sector. Taking fire. Need assistance. Probably not a head shot. Voice voice acting is pretty good. Can I jump here? Let's hug this red wall. Damn, the game looks really good. Okay. Uh, one thing I want to check. Let's go check how how magp packing works. Or is it instapac like um Oops. I keep pressing I. Okay. Currently instack, which is fine. Just wondering. It's like placeholder for now, I assume. Okay, let's loot. Hold F to loot. Ooh, that looks nice. A saw and painkillers. We take those. That aug looked pretty nice. Let's inspect. I to inspect. Let's go try this. Okay, I got to keep checking the map. I am just 100% lost right now. Okay, so you can see the other mark on the base. Okay, that's what I was looking for. There's a white box marker south of you at the map. Yeah, so this is this is the one we were looking at, right? Or are you talking about further south? So I'm looking for the other marker. Or is this the is this the only marker? Is there any other marker that I'm where I'm supposed to grab the thing? You can see the other mark on the base. Oh, dude. I did not see that. That was Okay, I get it now. I get it, dude. It was so camouflaged. It was pretty camouflaged, not going to lie. Okay. Well, there's a dude right there. Do I I don't think I want to shoot now. Um I'm like in a weird spot. I don't even have range. Security move. All right, dude. I'm going to hug that container. So, our objective is somewhere here. Wait, we saw the dude up here rather. So, let's not let's be careful of that. I hear footsteps next to me. I can't tell if he's actually here. Activity reported. Proceed with caution. Oh, take cover. Someone's close left here on the corner. I remember seeing someone up there. Was that the building with the stairs? the Oh my goodness. There's someone here. This AUG hits feels like it hits harder than my AK because the bullets are better slightly. Felt like earlier my AK was just they were just tanking my AK bullets. This has I think um a little more pen. [Music] Hold up. That guy didn't shoot me the whole time. Oh. [Music] He was hiding behind cover. You see his animation chat? He's hiding behind cover, but there was a window. But um yeah, cheat to that guy. One thing I'm um starting to like learn about these types of games is that um I always felt like every tactical shooter has to be very challenging to be fun. And then in the recent Oh my god, dude. He hit me. I've realized that sometimes just an immersive experience, even if it's not like crazy hardcore, is just a good time, too. Pick up item. Oh, it's my it's my quest. I just realized. Okay, that's the quest. Now, we got to take that to the to the compound earlier. Let's go check the tower if um if that dude has like a sniper scope. Oh, is that a foul? No scope on him, but is that a foul? Oh, boy. All right, let's get rid of that MP5. Wait, wait, wait. just just so we can see how the MP5 [Music] shoots. Okay, cool. We know how that works. Let's check out the [Music] foul. You're that MP5 rounders, too, is insane. What's the bullet on this? M80s penetration 22 damage 90ation level three. Uh, the F looks fun. I need a sight on this. See how this sounds. I was hoping that would sound beefier. Oh shoot. Holy. That suppression mechanic is pretty cool. straighter than you. See if we get a flank on this. How's flanking AI? Do they like see me through walls flanking kind of thing? Oh, they don't. That's pretty cool. Okay, little sketchy. Oh, I kind of remember this place. I've been here before. Okay, that was a lot of voices. We got a lot of gamers chat. I don't know where they are though. Mag check. We're close. We're about to get get uh lose lose it all. Nope. Tab. Um going to put this down here front. Whatever. Put that up there. We'll lose the mag. It's cool. Okay. So, I'm near it to my left. Oh, this is it. This is it. How do I know if if this is the right one? Is there like a notification or something? Nope. Yeah. Placed intel. Check mark. Perfect. So, that was the right one. Survive an extract from the area. Um okay. Okay, so our nearest X track's right here. It's open. Does not close. Another extract right here. That's too far. Opens in 2 minutes. Too far. Opens in 36 seconds. All right. So, just directly. We just got to fight our way out, I guess, to the west directly. Enemy spotted. Engage. Oh my goodness. That's what I heard the whole time. See what loot this has to offer cuz why not? Ooh, I was looking for that the whole time. You found one at the end of the raid, though. Let's see how this works. How do I How do I go zoom in? Zoom out. Middle mouse. Oh, toggle. Oh, so you hold middle mouse and then you scroll up. I mean, no, no, not scroll up. You move your mouse up and then Okay. All right, extract a nine. Eight. That was a That was a solid raid. Overall, a solid experience. Game definitely needs a lot of time to cook. And I'd love to see the AI to be more engaging in the future. Something like AI squads zoning in on my position as I shoot really loud guns, forcing me to want to run a suppressor for the extra tacticalness. But for only $1699, it could be a fun tactical Barbie game you could keep in your library. Three stars. Game looks amazing, but needs time to cook. This next game is one of the more highly requested games my community has asked me to check out in the last handful of months. And this video is the perfect excuse to finally check it out. It's called Hole, a single player extraction shooter for only $4.99 that looks like a game straight out of the late '90s. And this game does not hold your hand. It throws you straight in and you got to figure things out yourself. Okay, so I guess we just Oh, reload. Ooh, it it told me to mouse. Okay, microwave turn off. Wee. So, that's the extract mechanic of this game. Return home office level. Enter. Let's just go. Let's go with it. I think I have infinite ammo. Uh, I actually have no idea what I'm doing. Well, well, we're playing blind. Whatever. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. It's It's an extraction shooter, so I guess we just loot and figure it out as we go. The the lean gives me a little motion sickness. It's a It's a very intense lean. There's a little motion sickness involved with it for me. Or maybe I'm getting old. Whoa. Holy loot. Wait, what do I do with all this dopamine chat? Oh my god. Best game ever. Oh shoot. Okay. Okay. Reloading. Oh. Oh. Oh, you have to. Okay. The slide. I was aiming too high. Okay. Reload. And then after this chat, you got to boom. Oh, got them both. Nice. Yeah, that lean is is very intense. It's throwing me off a little bit, but okay. Money. Money is always nice. Got to grab all the money. I want to lean, but at the same time, There we go. So, always remember, mouse click. Oh, he went back to cover. That's cool. Okay, so what's important with these with these extra single player experiences is just fun AI. That was nice. That was a nice sign. So, there's a number in the bottom left that's that's continuously rising. I don't know what that is. I also don't know what I'm looting for. Okay, open that. Dude, are these SD cards or something? What is this? I don't even know what this is, but I'll take anything. That is the AI gear level. They get scarier over time. Oh, so the longer I stay, the harder they get, which kind of pushes me to to want to leave. Speaking of, he's got a Can I take a sniper? No, I don't think so. Right. I haven't Can I loot? No, I can't leave their body. No, I can't. So, what I understand as well is that AI fight each other. They're like different factions. All the AIs that look alike are friends. Maybe that's where we go. Yeah. See how they were fighting? Oh my god. Oh shoot. That was a shotgun and a half. Okay, it's getting a little more intense indeed. He's still alive. Oh, that made me sick. Oh, I just realized there's an overheat mechanic. Bottom right. Okay, I I only noticed that cuz my barrel was getting hot. All right, let's find an extract. I don't know how to extract. I I know the microwave is the extract. I don't know how to find it. Oh, here. It's extract. Let's get out of here. That was pretty fun. This game's interesting. Okay, so cash was Okay, cash was the coins. Data is the seven is the SD card looking thing. Uh, it also shows you how many of So again, each color is a different faction. We killed 14. There's four wave. We survived four waves time. Okay, retry. Let's go home first. Um, this is home. Okay. So, there's no main menu. Ooh. Okay. Ah, so build. What's the the the currency we got in game in raid? It's pretty. Okay. Okay. I see that. That is such a nice touch. Hello. What is this? Let's go talk to this show task card. Oh, okay. So, tasks. Okay. Can we accept all reward new key? I'm interested about this key. Oh, we can we can do all. Okay. So, five kill five of each. Okay. So, we go back and raid here. With my first set of quests in hand, I jumped in to eliminate five members from each AI faction. And the experience quickly got pretty intense. He's got a helmet. Since the AI difficulty increases the longer you stay in the raid, the game nails that extraction shooter adrenaline, but in a really simple, effective way. You can't linger too long or you'll start running into better geared enemies, so I had to move fast, complete my objectives, and extract before things got out of hand. It does get repetitive fairly quick, but the progression is what kept me going. Since I came into this with a blind playthrough, I was excited to see what I'd unlocked next on my base. And the biggest dopamine hit came when I completed a quest that rewarded me with a key. and I used this key to open a door and found a blue disc which once I returned home unlocked an AR-15. So that pulled me in deeper. I had to try it out even if I only had 10 round mags. My chat leader explained that the way to upgrade your weapons is to stay in the raid long enough for tougher enemies to spawn ones that drop mods. Never reached that point in my playthrough though, but it's a cool mechanic that encourages you to push your luck and stay engaged. One of my viewers summed it up perfectly. He said this might become his favorite lunch break game. Just a couple quick runs on his Steam Deck. Three and a half stars. For only $4.99, you can make lunch breaks fun again. Next is one of the most unique-l lookinging extraction shooters out there, but does it play as good as it looks? This is the Forever Winter. This is a game where you play as a scavenger. One of the narratives it tries to push is the idea that you are not the main character. Cuz when you're in raid, there's a whole war going down between three waring factions, Urusa, Europa, and Eurasia. And you are technically not part of the war. You're simply trying to make ends meet for yourself by scavenging valuables from the ongoing battles. And it's up to you how you navigate the world. Whether you decide to shoot everything on site or let the waring factions continue to fight and stay busy while you loot their scraps along the way. In today's mission though, Europa is offering me cash and gear to help them take down their Eurasian enemies. So, I accepted the offer since again I'm just trying to make ends meet here. Let's find some Eurasians. This is Europan Uruskan. So, we need 10 10 of these dudes. Europan as well. This has to be your Wait, no, that's your Ruskan. I'm looking for Eurasians. Whoops. Sorry, dude. That's Eurasian. Eurasian drone. There we go. That's uh six of 15. This is a Eurasian. Oh, well, they blew him up. All right. Thanks. This guy is Europan. We don't want that. This guy is your rusk gun. Not him either. Europan soldier. What are you fighting? Europan soldier. Europan soldier. They're all Europans. Don't get boxed in. They're probably fighting Eurasians right now. Let's go check them out. More radar. What are you guys? You're open as well. Reminds you of Gears of War. The the uh Yeah, the the point of view uh the third person definitely gives it that feel. And the the I guess the general art can give you a Gears of War feel as well. and the movement. I can see that. Okay, they all stopped fighting. Let's go to the other side of the map. Maybe we'll find more um box Eurasians on the other side. We only killed one so far. That's Europa. And who are they shooting? They're probably fighting a Eurasian. Is this I can't tag it. Hello. I I can't tell what what faction that is. Not that I want to fight a chopper, though. Look at that tank. Your rust gun still. It's Eurasian. I don't know if I want to fight a chopper though. Europan Ruskan Europan. Look for gaps. Maybe we can slip past. your Russ gun. Europan. Okay, so Europa and your Ruskan are definitely not friendly. They're fighting each other. Hold up. These are your Asians. Not going to lie, chat. I can't see what I'm shooting. I'm just uh Oh, no. I killed one, dude. I killed one in that whole army. I magnly killed one, dude. Uh, that's my kill. There we go. That's my kill. I thought I killed more than that there. Hey, leave me alone. Leave me alone. You guys stole my kills, dude. Leave me alone. Oh. Okay, we got two kills. I need I need seven more. So, you really want to watch your fire, Chad, and really uh pick your battles cuz you don't want to just shoot everything. That is a battle we don't want. Oh, that's that has to be Eurasian. Fight ahead, chat. The the the 50 cal is really slow. That's why we were whiffing our shots earlier. Look at that. Look how tough it is to Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay, there we go. That felt satisfying. Holy crap. What is all this? Wait, these are Eurasian. These are Eurasian. Uhoh. Did I shoot an exo? I shot an exo. I didn't mean to shoot an exoskeleton. Those those uh those crawling cyborgs, that's all Eurasian. Oh my goodness, dude. Oh my goodness. I whiffed everything. Need four more. Come on. That's my killer right here. Right in front. Right in front. The reload takes forever. One more. Oh, right there. Come on. It's in between the legs of the exoskeleton. There we go. Let's get out of here. Completed. Call it the hero. Call the her. Call the herd, rather. I thought it said call the hero. Call the herd. That's the quest we just finished. GG. All right. Let's get out of here. So, you can theoretically run through the middle of all this fighting and uh no one's going to shoot you cuz they're too busy fighting each other. You can run and uh catch bullets though, so be careful with that. All right. GG G. Back in September of 2024, this game went viral within the extraction shooter community for doing something completely different. While most titles in the genre focus on wiping out lobbies and grabbing as much loot as possible, The Forever Winter encouraged players to pick their battles and scavenge only what they needed. It's quite a polarizing game and still is, especially since it's still very early in development. At $29.99 for an unfinished game, it definitely took some heat. Three stars. A unique take, but far from developed. Next up, Escape from Duck. Yeah, you heard that right. Tarov, but ducks. The game begins with a classic tutorial showing how movement, looting, and combat works. Oh my god, dude. Wait, wait, wait. This is actually way more satisfying than I thought it would be. Loot. Ooh, our first gun. Oh, this game is way more morbid than I thought it'd be, too. Oh, chilling. We're chilling. Okay. Yeah, that kind of hurt. It then leads us to our first extract, bringing me into my hat out where it shows me that I can upgrade both my base and my character using different materials found in Raid, and of course, some money. So, this game's got all the fundamentals of a Tarov like extraction shooter. But the question is, does it play well? I went out into the world to explore and feel out the duck combat, and along the way, I found a random house. Wait, is this guy Is this an NPC or is this an enemy? Hello? Are we friends? Who is that? Oh my god, he's got abs on him. He's jacked. Here muscles, they're gifted. How about some sastic training with me? These trainings will not only strengthen your body but also enlighten your mind. Come here. I Your master is going to assign your first challenge, dude. All right. He is a thick duck indeed. What is the first challenge quest? Oh, he's got Okay. Submit eggs. Two eggs. Satisfy the protein needs of the muscular doug. The most important aspect to concern. My first challenge is find two eggs for me. Find while doing squat walks. Go. Remember, selfless makes you free. Dude, I Whoever made this game, dude, too lazy to sit. The devs have a good sense of humor. This is good. This is good. I remember that back in my hideout, there's a vending machine where I can buy eggs. So, I decided to head home to grab some for this jack duck. But trying to get home was an adventure in itself. Oh, I was about to shoot my own pet. Okay. Okay. I was trying to see chat if I could uh if I could bait him into shooting and then I just dodged, but that's not working, dude. Okay, this guy is Can my pet please bite him or something? Okay, so you really got to got to peek him and then just um Oh, medium bullets. Don't want to hurt. You got to Oh, shoot. Oh my god. Why is everyone so juiced out of nowhere? Okay. Okay. We're We're into deep chat. We got to get home. I'm out of meds. Okay. What's the nearest extract? These guys are so juicy now. Out of nowhere. So, I got to peek and and and like mag dump. It's the It's the way. I am so hurt, though. I just realized I'm not using my my pet. I got to put stuff in my my my uh pets bag. Like, I don't know. Yarn. Put it there. Shoot. I I need to get home. Let's put the better bullets. I'm going to get dropped, dude. I never knew I'd be playing very slow and escape from Duckov. I'll be honest. Out of nowhere, this got super sweaty out of nowhere. Do that later. Oh, shoot. There's a dude in here. Oh, no. Uh-oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm on HP. I'm on HP. Oh [ __ ] Oh my god. Oh my god. I have one tree. Oh my god, dude. One HP in a dream joy. Loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I don't think I should loot him. I think I should just go home. Loot. Oh my god. Let's get out of here. Oh my god. I survived with one HP. Let's get out of here, boys. All right. Welcome back. Jeez, dude. That was sweat. Barely surviving. I grabbed the two eggs at home and brought it back to the muscular duck, successfully finishing my first ever quest in Escape from Duck Offov. I then unintentionally ended up playing for about another hour, not realizing how much more fun I was having than I thought. For what it is, the game is actually pretty fun. It's currently free on Steam, but only a demo is available. No word on how much the game's going to be yet, and it plans to fully release sometime in 2025. Three and a half stars. If you can get past the fact that you're a duck, it can get addictive. And last, but definitely not the least, Zero Severt. I didn't think I'd like this game initially because of the visuals, but I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. It starts like your usual hardcore survival or extraction shooter where it does not hold your hand. You're meant to slowly discover things on your own by interacting with the world and talking to strangers. So, I spoke to this bartender who gave me full context of where I am. We're in Zero Severt, the only safe place in Zach, the city we're currently standing on that was destroyed by a huge nuclear power plant explosion. And from there, we got to figure everything else out ourselves as I was tasked to kill five wolves and in return, money and some gear from the bartender. So, I set out on my first adventure ever in the city of Zach. One thing to note is the difficulty of the game is highly customizable. I'm currently playing on the default medium difficulty of the game called Survivor. In this mode, if I die, I return back in time to the moment before we left the base, still with all my gear. At higher difficulties, you can set it to where you lose all your gear, like Tarov or even a perma death mode. But for this session, as I still try to learn the ins and outs of zero sever, I'm playing on its standard survivor mode. So, we're looking for five wolves. Oh my god. Okay, that hurt. Okay. Okay. All right. Where was his body? Oh my goodness. Oh, there it is. Ketter. Durability 50. Is it better than mine? Is it worth keeping, dude? This guy. What the was that? He's getting so much stuff on him. Bad water though. Screw nut. I guess sounds useful. Tea bag. There's so much stuff. This is again it's like Tarov all over again. Like what the hell is all this? But um this is heavy indeed. I'll move slower. I'll just drop stuff if I don't know what the what they do. Um, what is why is my not thirsty, not hungry, well-rested, not irrit Okay, I think what I want to do for now is I'm going to hover closer to my extract and see if I could farm wolves near my extract. Oh, those are bores. Hold up. Hold up. With my first death in this game, I knew that the only way to learn this game was the hard way. And I was all in. Oh my god, dude. Oh my god. You freaking extract camper. There's no way. Death after death, I gain a little more confidence and already I felt the addiction pulling me in. I started feeling it, understanding the flow of the game as I finished my first quest. And if you're wondering how I feel about this game after my first task, well, I've been playing this game a lot when I take little breaks from editing this video. Literally every break I get to catch, I'm on zero sever. I'm absolutely loving this game and I'm looking forward to doing a perma death run one day. But for now, it's a lot of learning the hard way. Five stars. Don't let the visuals fool you. Best game ever. These single player extraction shooters are a good chill time. But if you want to squeeze in some PvP, you might want to try one of these games from this video right here. Thank you to our patrons.

      "content": "对，我们不会去做那种为了一小部分人利益去切大部分人蛋糕的事情。它是一个大多数能获利的事情，那我们可能就不去动它。通货膨胀就是钱太多了，货不够多，那很简单，把货变多就好了。打人其实永远是难的吧，往往他还是要求你一些跟你不擅长的方式进行这种P P那其实很恶心人。但安区不是这样的，对于各种各样操作技巧能力的玩家，其实都能把安区。搜有打车都打车，上到6旬老汉，下到小学家。豪哥今天嘴里念叨最多的游戏标签可能就是搜打车。所以火城这个熊样现在在纠结这个玩法到底好不好玩，已经纯属多余。而且这个赛道下的参赛选手们也全都是有备而来，有的游戏背书顶，有的老来俏，有的小而美。显然搜打社这个玩法下还有更多意想不到的可能，玩家的选择也越来越多了，比如暗区突围这个搜打社老兵在稳定运营三年后，终于在月初时把日活数据干到了千万。而前两年玩家社区就一直存在的回头是岸的声音，近期也是像众人拾柴一样被更多人听到并迅速传播。主要是现在的暗区和S一赛季那个初来乍到的新游戏相比已经不可同日而语。我猜测这次日活数据的飙升，也许是因为一直以来的优化调整，让玩家看到了117小眼镜下的暗卓涌动。比如游戏的玩法就在肉眼可见的变得多样，战术能力、更多的实验性道具以及各种新模式的加入，使得这个看似门槛很高的游戏还在不断吸引新玩家入坑，越来越给大伙一种硬核但不难的感觉。但要想知道暗剧的一些真实想法，还是得起个六套去模仿，找找卡莫纳活着的传奇17问1问，看看在他理解下的搜打车到底是怎么一回事儿，以及暗区这么久以来究竟在做哪些事儿，又为啥要这么做？那下面就把时间交给117，听听这位可能是国内人气最高的游戏策划是如何做，谢。其实我们自己在一开始做这个产品的时候，不是以所谓的搜打车这个逻辑去做的。我们本身实际上更多把它看作一个单局化的沙盒。这种单局化的沙盒它有很多的可能性，你在里面当然可以搜，可以打客一车。或者说我更早的时候更只是把它当做一个玩家自驱式的公路片来看待。在整个暗区的游戏的整个单局过程中，我们会视它为一个呃从出生啊，从就是复活，然后一直到撤离，然后从A到B点的这样一个公路片。所以我们并没有去说去想着说以搜打车的方式来去定义这个产品。我觉得最大的特点是说暗区的战斗，它的这种关注的点不仅仅是操作。因为大家会觉得说很多时候觉得说烈度大，实际上是操作频率高，然后是屏幕晃动的快，身法非常多，然后瞄准，然后射击的频率非常高。那其实暗区不完全是这样的，就暗区的这样一种烈度可能更多指的是你的博弈的烈度。你可能很多时候虽然你是在只是在走，可能甚至只是在听，但是你是持续在关注周围的这样一种信息。然后你是不断的思考说当下到底什么位置，会有什么样的人。然后同时这个时候我该做什么，是对自己或对自己的小队是最有用的，是最有利的。这种思考的攻烈度我觉得是一点也不低的。所以很多时候大家觉得按区的节奏慢，可能更多只是他操作上的节奏稍微会慢啊。当然他也有快的时候，对吧？大家也看到就是按区很像很多非常精彩的这种击杀技金，就是他也有快的时候，但是可能更多时候你需要按心思去想，我觉得这可能是按区非常不同的一个地方。他提供了一些可能让我这样操作技巧没有那么好的玩家，也能获得很充分的这种战斗博弈乐趣的这样一个环境。它是一个你能够用更多的不一样的这种优势去获得战斗胜利的这样一个环境，我觉得这是第一个很大的不一样。第二个我觉得很不一样的点是呃，我觉得岸区是一个相对而言更沙河，然后是更鼓励多样生态的游戏，就是什么样的生活方法在这个游戏里面都可以生存下来。那我以前就看过我们的这样一些可能创作者，他们说暗区至少有好几种玩法，有梦攻的，有那种属鼠的，有那种刮地皮的，还有那种可能相对而言比较伺机而动的这只是单纯的战斗层面的这种策略的不同。那实际上还有目标层面的那实际上有人喜欢收集东西，那有人喜欢做挑战性的这些任务和这种挑战性的目标，那有人就喜欢P P那可能还有人就是说啊为的是我赚更多的这种代币，然后去换阿瓦塔。对，就每个人他的这种游戏目标是不一样的。对所以当你的目标乘以你的这样一个可能说战斗逻辑和你的行为逻辑，你其实这个游戏里是有非常多不一样的这种玩法生态的这样而且这种是我们在设计之中就非常充分去考虑这种包容性。就我觉得这种包容性和可能那只鼓励大家去猛攻去打的游戏是非常不一样。我觉得两层作用啊，一层作用是人机会提供一定程度的物资，就是它是一个移动的物资点。这个特别是对于喜欢超级低成本进入单局的人来大家来说，它是非常重要的物资点，对吧？我去搞一个人机，然后就变身了。对，就躲舍流对他们来说是很重要的玩法。那另一个点是说，呃，对于像暗区这样的游戏，其实为什么叫暗区？就是因为他的信息非常少。那在这样一个可能有一点点黑暗森林的环境中，大家会倾向于都不要发出声音，一点信息都不给别人。那在这个这样的环境下其实很无聊的那大家都是完全都是说没有任何的信息情况下，所有人最后的结果就是要么蹲到死，蹲到死结果上不如不玩。要么就冲到死，就是一路飘流去，按照自己的既定路线冲进某个地方，然后再再冲出去，其实他是很无聊的。所以我们提供人际上是提供了一些让大家产生信息交互的机会，然后我们可以利用人机这种工具，然后产生这样的信息交互，然后进而与其他玩家进行博弈。他最终让这个可能说整个舞台上变得更生机勃勃，会产生更多样的故事啊，所以我觉得这这是人机对于可能说整一个可能这种搜车游戏来说。或者对于这种沙盒类的单据沙盒游戏来说很重要的一个点嗯。我觉得硬核这个事情可能更多指的是一种风格。首先我们先解先解释一下大家认为的硬核啊。就实际上很多时候大家认为硬核的东西，就包括我们说硬核科技，对吧？它实际指的是说呃非常厉害的，然后是说是大家需要花费一些努力然后才能获得的东西。所以我是这么去理解这个硬核这样一件事情啊，具体的暗区里面的话，那我觉得首先它肯定是厉害的。暗区三在22年啊上线的时候，无论是从技术本身来说，还是说游戏玩法来说，都是非常非常厉害的那其次呢暗趣是一个需要大家花费一些心思去想一想怎么玩的游戏。所以我们会觉得说这样的游戏是硬核的那当然这是我们最开始对硬核的一些可能最初的科学看法吧。那到后来说我们会觉得说其实硬核更多的是一种态度，是一种较真的态度。可能很多人会觉得说我们就是会把硬核和难或这件事情去绑在一起。我不否认就是说可能会有人这么觉得啊，但是我觉得硬核就不一定需要难，包括可能说呃一些像鸭子弹这样也相对比较慢的东西啊，我觉得是我们刻意为之的。因为我们觉得说如果一个游戏它的所有的操作的这种兑现效率都非常高。那么最后的结果就是很容易把大家全部都引入到去比拼操作的这个阶段中去。那么其实就像一个生态一个生态中，如果只比拼单一的这样一种维度的东西的话，它是高度内卷的。然后在这里面大家就只去比这个东西，其实是不利于这个生态多样性和这种稳固性的，实际上也不利于这个生态去长期发展。所以我们刻意的稍微控制了操作上面的这种上限。同时我们通过压慢节奏，让大家可以去自多通过一些思考，通过一些信息收集，然后通过一些环境判断这样一些玩法，帮助他们获取这样一个博弈的胜利啊，所以我们刻意的去稍微压慢了一些节奏。但我觉得它带来的好处啊，从目前看起来，我认为还是多于他的这样一些可能产产生的问题。他的好处就是让更多的人可以玩这种游戏，而不是像很多的这样一些射击游戏。其实你稍微多玩一会儿，你会发现他对你操作技巧是有很强的要求的。你没有达不到这个操作技巧要求没法玩。但按需不是这样的，就是我们对于各种各样操作技巧能力的玩家，其实都能玩暗区。暗区有很多枪械也好，武器也好，还有其些装备也好，其实都是非常拟真的，有很多现实原型做参考。能稍微举几个例子给我们听听。我们的Q191啊是获得了一个正式的官方授权的，有充分的这样一个官方授权资料参考，然后进行一个设计。包括的192的191这3把枪都是我认为是说应该就是目前最还原的最好的这样一个游戏。抛开这些东西的话，那暗中还有很多其他一些非常拟真的这样一些枪械，同时又有一定的这种改装自由度的游戏中，这些枪都是最棒的。首先让你去的枪械的手感其实相对而言是比较拟真。然后即便是在这样是训练的很好的一个情况下呢，他依然是可能有一些的很强大的后坐力，很大程度上们就是模拟了这样的一些状态。我们自己的其些枪械策划他们也是非常厉害的。他们会自己去找时间去找海外的靶场去打靶，然后他们也会研究这种可能说整个枪械持握的时候的整个人体的这样人机工学。他到底现实中大概人的肌肉大概是怎么样去聚枪，包括这里面的一些手感啊这些东西，我们都是有比较专业的这样一些指导，然后去做到这样一个我们目前认为是在体验的爽感与真实性中取得一个比较好的平衡这么一个位置。因为这是一个更硬核拟真的这样一种玩法。其实在安区刚开始做的时候，我们其实就一直在考虑之前的话我们还是去努力的试图让所有人都接受这件事情。但我们也会发现就是说其实现在大家的这样一种需求是在慢慢的有分化的。那种统一的单一一个模式呢，可能并不能把所有人的需求都拧在了一起。那其实我们尝试着去在过去的几个版本中做了一些更加的可能，让大家觉得舒适的东西。但是同时我觉得就会说离我们最开始想要的东西会有一些距离。所以我们就把我们最开始觉得说应该给到玩家那个东西就翻了出来。对，仅此而已。硬核模式它人机也更强了，然后可能玩家也会更谨慎，它的难度也变得更高了。对应的产出有没有想过提高一点，比如说物资的爆率之类的。我们会认为说其实我们原本的所有的爆率这件事情，其实是为了给大家提供这样一种惊喜感。它实际上是一个可能说你有多大概率摸到什么样一个东西，然后他就会有一个比较好的这种感受。这个概率如果过的太高了，其实他是从惊喜感的范畴跳出来了，他变成了一个日常打工。所以其实这个是我们到目前为止觉得说呃暗区的强风的这个暴率，其实已经是一个非常适合的一个暴率。有没有办法去提高这种惊喜感呢？我们也会在聊。但是说到目前为止的状况下面，我们认为更高的爆率只会让这个对局变得可能更公式化，变得更像打工，有悖于可能按需不存。原本想给大家提供那种惊细感的体验，所以我们目前并不打算去提高这样的一个爆率。那至于怎么给大家进一步的去提升精细感，我们还得想一些办法。你说我卖个关子，好的好的好的。啊，我们首先会考虑这件事情是什么呢？首先这是一个大多数人都会去参与的，还是一个极小部分人的这样事情，这是一件事。第二个事情是说他是不是将整一个蛋糕啊过度的向某些人去倾斜了啊，就切向了某些人。如果我们最后判断说他是一个大多数人能获利的事情，那我们可能就不去动它。我们会考虑说它可能是个正常现象。那只是说这个正常现象的话，他会不会可能有什么其他的附带影响。那我们可能会更多的考虑一下这件事情，但可能不会立刻去对他进行一个操作啊，但是我们可能更多的动刀子是一小部分人然后高度获利的东西。就是比如像我们可能某一种技巧，他只有一小部分操作非常强的玩家他会掌握，但是他会对其他人产生一个很强的碾压。那我们可能会对这些东西做一些处理或者一些调优。但是如果他是一个大多数人都会去参与的，然后我觉得也没有什么太大问题的东西的话，或者他可能也没有动特别多人蛋糕的东西，那我觉得就还好吧。啊会对我们不会去做那种就是说就是可能为了一小部分人利益去切大部分人蛋糕的事情。对，这种事情我觉得不合适嘛，对吧？嗯，对，所以我觉得先分清楚这个问题的，就矛盾的关键点是什么？他到底是一小撮人和大多数人的矛盾，还是大多数人的内部的矛盾，对吧？想清楚这件事情就好了嗯。首先其实从统计数据上来看啊嗯就是我们虽然做了一些优化改动，但其实这个设立比例的角度来看，他差异并没有那么大。他只是说让那些本该撤离的人更好的能撤离了。那其实大家很多时候在玩这个游戏的过程中，他实际上是一种可能不那么惜密的状态。那这种状态下面他的撤率率其实是一样的。其次就是说可能看起来宏观策率还是高了一些，确实也会对你的整一个物价什么的都有一些影响。但是同时我觉得比较好的点是对于可能所有的玩家中相对能力比较低的那一部分，相对而言可能撤疑率比较低的那些人，他们的帮助反而是更大的。嗯，就是那些真正想要撤，但是又因为种种种种原因没法撤的人，其实他们是获得了最大buff。那对于这些人呢，其实我们觉得说呃帮助他们提高生活水平也挺好的。很多大家现在在用通货膨胀这个概念的时候，实际上指的是物价飞涨。它并不是指的就是什么学术意义上的通货膨胀。其实如果纯粹是从通货膨胀的逻辑概念上来看的话，它本质上是一个钱多货多的问题。通货膨胀就是钱太多了，货不够多。那很简单，把货变多就好了，从逻辑上就是这么样的一个逻辑。对那至于货变多了之后会不会带来别的问题，那可能这个是我们要去思考的。以及他会不会带来什么别的一些顾虑，或者是这样可能有些人会担忧的影响游戏寿命，那这个时候我们策划是要去解决的问题。大家要知道实验品其实你是在实验品箱目中摸出来的，或者在实验品空投中拿到的，其实它的概率是没有那么高。那么我们经常会想说，那我们是不是可以在大区的战斗中增加某一样东西，让这个战斗变得更加有趣。有一些可能突如其来的这种很沙盒性的这种啊迸发式的这种快乐。那实际上我们会本来就会有很多的脑爆，那其中可能会有不同方向啊，有可偏战术能力型的，就偏信息能力型的。然后是可能会有一些更粗暴的攻击能力，比如像火箭弹，也可能会有像刚才说的，就自己的能力增强型的这种啊真啊蒸汽之类的东西。那这可能是大的几条赛道啊，我们在每一个赛道中都会有一些自己延续，就觉得什么东西可能会让这个游戏变得更有趣的一些东西。然后呢，那实验品实际上对我们来说这是一个试验场了。对我们可能会先把它放到实验品的这样一个环境中去。如果他对整个战斗或整个单局的影响，那我觉得可以接受的话，那我们可能慢慢就把它拿出来，然后并进入到赛季物资啊，然后可能甚至变成正式物品。然后我们这次还有了新的这个战术能力的这个引入，引入这个战术能力的契机是什么呢？战术能力背后大概是有两层的思考。第一层是说我们会发现其实大家都有一些很个性的一些玩法。这些很个性的玩法它本身他可能都会要求我们改某一样东西。但是我们会发现，如果我们把所有这些个性玩法全部都满足的话，它带来一个后果就是可能这里全是超人，然后整个世界已经非常乱套了。但我们又希望给大家一些很独特的东西。所以我们去尝试说用这种战术能力的框架就把它都包含在内里，我觉得这是第一个契机。第二期就是我们会发现新玩家的需求和老玩家需求可能会有一些不太一样。那我们同样说想做一些东西去帮助老玩家，也同样想做一些东西帮助新玩家。那我们有没有办法把他们在一个框架里面去包容下来，让大家都能够获得好的体验。对其实这就是我们在做战神的时候，最开始触发思考的两样东西。目前来看的话，我觉得我们第一期战术能力还相对比较稳健和保守。那先看看大家反馈吧，战术能力因为他现在是要做任务去获得，就是我们获取任务的难度大概有一个什么样的预期。难度其实我觉得都是设的比较低的，或者说他不是难度型的，他可能需要玩家花费一些时间啊，就像我之前也发过一期节目专门说的，任务的和难度实际上我们大概归类有三大类。第一大类呢就是那种相对而言需要你一命通关的，就是你一条命做好多事儿的，叫我们称之为地容错。第二大类呢就是说啊那些可能pvp的要求比较独特的，让你用某种特殊的方式去批vp然后跟着并且达成某些比较难的pp条件。因为大家知道就是打成其实永远是难的嘛，何况是一些很特殊的批方式，往往他还是要求你一些可你不擅长的方式去你这种P那其实很恶心的人。然后第三种就是说可能说是一些非常拼脸的，就是可能方差很大的，需要很概率获得的东西。我们这次至少在做战术能力的思考的时候，我们并不希望去做任何这样一些东西。所以我觉得难度上可能不会很大，可能会一点点的难度。但是他可能会稍微需要你一点花一点时间，所以很多东西可能需要一点时间积累，其实很快就能做出来啊，并不会太困难。那我们是不是也可以理解成么？比如说就算对应到现实里，比如说一个战术技能是让我们跑步更快。然后我在现实里就是一直去重复这个跑步，跑步我我本身也会跑这来一块，然后这个任务大概就是以这种其实也是一个相对来说比较拟真的一个形式去完成完。啊，是的，有有一些类似的这样一些设计逻辑，但可能并不完全是这样啊。对对，但是其中一部分的设计逻辑是类似的。Ok好的。它就是一种实验品嘛，对吧？而且我们也非常清楚的知道，在所有的F74里面，盾这个东西都是挺危险的。嗯，对它可能会带来非常多不可预期的东西，所以我们也是非常适应性的把它放进来之前版本们把它放在了AI身上对吧，大家对它意见就很大对吧。但是现在自己拿到的时候呢，就觉得还可以对吧，这是很很正常一件事情，所以对这个东西我们比较审慎啊，所以他现在只能在实验品中比较低的概率去获得。他可能只是大家现在整个可能说战斗过程中一个调剂，一个有趣的突发了偶然的事情。其实大家都知道，就是现在整个业界在做匹配的时候，用的分跟段位都是没有关系的，称之为表分与理分嘛嗯对吧？其实按照表分匹配的游戏，其实基本上都已经被市场淘汰了。没有什么游戏是按照表分匹配的啊，就包括我玩街86，嗯，街八六的都是有表里分的。就是我如果就是连胜的次数比较多，我即便可能就是一个白银黄金的水平，我还是可能会遇到钻石，甚至是啊更厉害的。所以匹配上面来说，他的策略就已经是说呃完全是按照所谓的理分来进行策匹配了。那同时的话按区设也还是做了一些啊专利性的创新的啊，当然我是因为是专利还没申请下来，所以我不能说啊就我们找到了一些很好的匹配方法，能够去让这个对局中的人然后是有一定的多样性。然后但同时也不会影响大家的，或者说就产生太极端的这种体验，能够保证就是说大家的这种啊能力啊、水平啊还是在一个相对合适的范围内。但只是他在不同的方向上，所以最后才产生一些非常有趣的独特的体验。我觉得听劝这件事情是大家给我的标签，不是我自己想达的标签。对，因因为我自己实际上只是说我会听很多不同人的意见。对，因为我在我自己节目以前都说过，嗯，就是每个人他实际上都是代表自己的意见。然后这就是个赛博小社会嘛，嗯嗯每个人都有自己的想法，有自己的利益归属。那最后我们做一个可能这个赛博小社会的气调控者，我们能做的事情就是说要很小心的告诉告诉自己，就是说你做的每件事情都是在不断切蛋糕，你干心可能是把某一些蛋糕从一些人手里面切到另一些人手里面。其实这件事情我们是很慎重的。所以我们在努力做的是让大多数人可能整体上获益的这样一种选择。嗯，所以大家会觉得我挺劝，那是因为大多数人觉得啊他们获得了好处。那那肯定有很多人骂我的，经常有很多人骂我的对吧？那对不起，动了你们的蛋糕。首先我想说是暗虚是一个实常玩法非常多样的游戏啊啊不论你是一个什么样的人啊，你是一个喜欢战斗的人啊，还是一个喜欢动脑筋的人。还是一个你喜欢花时间去搬砖，然后去获得一些可能说收益和价值的人。还是说你是一个喜欢社交然后与朋友一起玩的人。啊，我觉得暗区都能给到你很不错的体验。你可以在这里面猛攻啊，你可以在里面去花时间去了解各种各样的机制，然后利用这些机制技巧，然后去达成一些别人所不能达成的东西。然后你也可以说可能在里面获得很好的这种成长的这样一个财富积累。然后同样的话，你也可以和你的朋友一起很愉快的进行这个游戏啊。他会跟你很难忘的真正的是一起扛过墙的体验，和以往的所有的这种这击游戏那种一起扛过墙的感受都不一样。它真的值得你们花一点心思，花一点时间耐心的来玩一下。它不会辜负你所花费的这些时间。这次的采访对话其实还有不少，但有些内容涉及到后续版本的更新计划，属于是机密文件了，那没法给大伙都放出来，我自己憋的也是相当难受。只能说未来的暗区还将整出不少的大活，绝对值得期待。要说这次的对谈，让我印象最深刻的则是100 17对硬核的理解啊。追求硬核不是为了把游戏做难，而是为了让游戏更牛逼、更好玩，而牛逼的东西就永远不愁没有人玩。能有这种觉悟，难怪总被调侃为唯一敢自己开账号的策划，以至于现在不仅100 17，就连马枪怪美术组也都跟进注册了账号。别的先不谈，光是暗区这种跟玩家之间零距离坦诚相待的勇气就挺难得。但如今这个纷乱的市场下，哪款游戏是最好的搜打车想必永远不会有定论。但暗区选择走的这条路，我个人是十分认可的，不是按着头强迫玩家去搜物资、打架、撤离，而是在用战场信息的线索模拟出真实战场感，引导玩家思考怎么搜、怎么打、怎么撤，也就是说玩法的决定权始终都在玩家手里。我想这才是让硬核手游这两个一眼看上去可能都不搭边的词儿被如此多玩家认可的关键。在多个赛季的优化更新后，暗区在上手难度方面已经算是完全没有啥门槛。爆率这一块强风下必出大金资源点增加，还有安全区模式给玩家保底，撤离条件上已经全模式常驻常规撤离点，没有一点刁难玩家的意思，就像一七自己说的那样，玩家喜闻乐见，他又有啥理由去做限制？当然在留住玩家这一块，暗区团队的原则也永远不是故意拉长玩家的游戏时长，调高货架以增加游戏寿命，而是想方设法丰富对局的体验，给玩家带来新鲜感。玩游戏嘛，本来就该是一件自由快乐的事儿，汉剧可能是明白了这个道理。当然，不少玩家回头是岸，以至于在运营三年已经积累1.8亿用户后，还能有新的成绩。反正到了最后我就只想说一句话，那就是站在玩家这边总归是不会出错的。好了，这里是差评游戏部，你第一次接触暗区突围是在什么时候呢？关于这款游戏你有没有什么感悟或者说是建议，欢迎发在弹幕评论区我们一起来聊一聊。那这期节目就到这儿，我们下期节目见。",

      "content": "手打册手打册这么全是手打册，不知道大家发现没有，现在的游戏不管适不适合手打册玩法，都要硬塞个手打册模式进去，融不进的圈子。他非要用是哪些游戏我就不知道了啊，因为是我瞎说的。屏幕前玩过搜打册模式的扣一，我看看有多少，一般我都是玩这个游戏搜打册。哈喽大家好，我是小不敢。大家肯定经常听说过手打册。那究竟什么是搜打册啊？就是搜不到、打不过、撤不走啊。不对，应该是交战搜索倒头就睡。归归正题，搜打出玩法给玩家带来了全新的体验。在传统的fps游戏里，核心乐趣基本就是对枪，像之前爆火的大逃杀模式，谁一枪玩好准赢，遇到挂狗除外。但是搜打车玩法不一样，他把核心乐趣从单纯的对枪转移到了资源的获取和争夺上。钢枪不再是最终目标，而成了实现目标的手段，这就给玩家提供了许多策略选择的空间。举个例子，在玩家入场前就要做好这把玩法的思路，是做个无情的跑刀仔，还是穿上了一套猛攻，亦或者当一只吃剩饭的鼠鼠。但不管什么方式入场，你都得省点打子弹，那可都是家底啊。一局游戏下来，你有可能夺舍成功，也有可能血本无归，这种高风险高回报的刺激体验让人欲罢不能。今天就来随便盘点几款手打侧游戏的优缺点。首先说说前段时间刚刚突破1200万的日活的黑马三角洲行动。三角洲最注重的就是打，打赢了爽子，打输了家爆率这一现象，主要是三角都给角色注入了技能机制，和无畏契约有点相似。每个人都有自己独特的战术道具，有的还可以喷气飞天舒性，使用技能搭配就可以衍生出很多出色的打法，当然还出现了不少出生玩法。如果你在房间里突然遇到一个甚至一群拿盾牌的，那你可就要小心了，你将会体验最绝望的死法。还有那个夺射流红狼，那B M1小头甲枪胸挂背包，一秒夺射，等你被拉起来，枪早就上架交易行了。每个干员都有一个特殊的玩法，但最出圈的还是乌露露同志。在乌露露同志面前，你打的再牛逼又怎样，你有护航又怎样，你能撤得走吗？不服就跟巡航飞弹说去吧，你竟然会在公屏看到这三个字，杜桥来。杜桥算是乌露露的畜生玩法了，别的干员顶多也就一两个，而他中叶的霸顶狙巴克斯的炸车离点，一旦被他看到，小灰贵就飞来了。以上这些玩法都是因为三角洲的角色有技能，打的爽是游戏的最大优点。那缺点嘛，猛攻大概率会回归大霸跑刀，这1.3角洲玩家应该深有体会。相比上讲说老大哥暗区突围可以算是非常硬核的摸金游戏了。无论是天气、脚步、食物、枪械都非常的硬核，极大的还原了真实场景。就先来说说天气系统空一张地图有着不同的游戏体验，夏天的地图格外的烫脚，这时候来场大暴雨降降温了，视野没那么清晰了，耳朵也没那么好使了，直接刺激翻倍。那再说说这个脚步，有时候你只要露一下犄角，可能直接成为劣势方了，刺激感翻倍，说不准下一秒眼就会贴脸给你打招呼。再来说说食物，一进游戏还有饥饿时口渴直，你可以在忙里偷闲来份红烧排骨犒劳一下自己，甚至还有鲱鱼罐头，这要是有个相机可以直接在游戏里录制挑战鲱鱼罐头了。这个喝水也很有意思，像直接喝完了，罐子都是直接丢。而这个保温杯就不一样了，会很耐心的把瓶盖拧起来，拧完以后再丢。那接下来再说做枪械，如果你入场没带过弹夹，那么你在换子弹的时候就需要一颗一颗的去压子弹，是不是非常硬核？不过最新版本新增的五个电脑终端和8个摄像头，也就是说玩家可以通过终端看到摄像头下面的人。喜欢猛攻的小伙伴一定会非常喜欢只有躲在角落的鼠鼠默默流泪。虽然暗区的这些细节都非常硬核，但也确确实实让玩家更加沉浸其中。缺点也很明显，人机才是真大哥。下一款地铁逃生是和平精英里出的搜打车模式。地铁逃生除了常规收物资战斗对抗，还加入了收集火车票、激活地铁车辆等独特玩法。玩家不再仅仅专注于击败敌人，还需要完成特定任务，增加了游戏的趣味性与可玩性。同时新武器和装备武器列传、吸盘枪等的加入，丰富了战斗方式，满足了不同玩家的战术需求。地图相对较小，节奏快，还有丰富的天气系统。缺点的话还是有挺多的，个人认为第一就是画质，其他可以在评论区补充。除了以上几款游戏，可以把你们心目中最好的手打册游戏打出来。",

      "content": "最近搜打车游戏赛道的成员真的是越来越多，从前些天刚结束测试，今天正式上线的安居端游，还有下半年陆续要上线的十几款游戏，不知道你们最看好哪款呢？但比起搜打车，我还是更喜欢观众不开玩笑了，搜打车顾名思义是以搜集、打架、撤离为驱动力的游戏闭环玩法，熟悉游戏的观众可能会知道，这套框架其实很早就已经存在，比如全境封锁一中的暗区模式。所以究竟是加了些什么机制，才让以塔可夫暗区突围为首的这类现代搜打车游戏大放异彩，让无数玩家为他着迷呢？直接说最大的原因便是搜打车游戏处处充满了赌徒心理。最简单也是最容易被玩家忽视的一点就是搜刮容器时的战利品。颜迟显示用的其实和刮刮乐一样的设计。神经科学家发现，当奖励不可预测时，多巴胺会在每次奖励出现前提前释放，而玩家每次搜刮容器得等一会儿才知道是什么，和刮刮乐需要手动刮出才能显示结果的目的正是为了制造期待阶段，让玩家持续分怒多巴胺。这也是为什么手游抽卡时总有一段动画前摇目迪也是一样的，而且你知道吗，点赞其实也可以分泌多巴胺哦。视频中有三个按钮就是你的快乐开关给up点赞。Up有你买orange给多肉吃。而在暗区端游中，由于随机掉落极止，玩家是有机会直接摸到大金的。而正是这种不确定性，会迫使玩家反复探索同一区域来追求下次报复的可能性。这种设计在心理学中叫做变率强化。但这种上瘾机制基本是个游戏都会用。真正让缩打彻独立出大世界射击另辟赛道的是他加入了经济系统。涉及到钱了，事情可就没那么简单了。就像德州扑克一样，玩家每次进入地图都会要求带入一定的筹码，玩家携带的装备相当于底牌质量全装玩家倾向于主动猎杀，类似于德芙中的加注施压，跑刀仔呢则更多选择跟住观察隐蔽发育。而随着战局的进行，游戏的战况就像公共牌一样逐渐明朗起来，哪地方有枪声，哪地方被搜过了，都会左右玩家的行动。是选择增加风险继续深入，还是选择保守撤退？游戏中充满了随机性，玩家们每次选择都是一次博弈，撤退路上可能会碰到正在舔包的敌人，进攻路上也会碰到正在蹲守的另外一队，这也正是搜打车游戏局内博弈的魅力。往往一念之差就会影响整场比赛的结果，所以每个玩家都能在游戏里找到适合自己的定位。是秉持着高风险高回报的理念直冲热门屋资点光枪，还是选择岁月静好的郊外摸金生活？这是我体验了游戏的北山后得到的感受。也正是这点加上极高的死亡代价，让对局更具有随机性。均是拟真风格，加上短tk和5准星也会增加玩家的沉浸感。而且这次暗区端游的音效效果做的还不错，移除了手游中的声纹系统，端游真的靠自己的耳朵来辨别敌人的方位和数量。随着脚步的临近，你的神经也逐渐紧绷，握着鼠标的手此刻仿佛真的像是放在了扳机上，最后成功击杀，罗巴胺的分泌也在此时达到顶点。鲜少有游戏能像苏打车一样如此频繁的调动玩家的肾上腺素。而且身上的装备价值越高，压力也就越高，最终撤离带来的释放也就越爽。而暗区端游还原了热点是十分不错的，尤其是在暴雨天气的时候，雨水打在面罩和枪上时，暗区像是变了快游戏似的，再加上堪比白噪声的女生，要不是还得专心踢脚步，不然还真想好好在农场看看风景的。但是脚步音效的上下区分依然不明显，而且声音过于通透，希望官方还是要继续改进。但现代做大车不仅有局内博容易，而且还有局外资源的影响，这也是搜打车这个框架最惊明的地方。玩家每次成功撤离后，搜集到的东西会被简单规划成货币。相比于其他游戏的货币，只能买些用处不大的皮肤、饰品，搜打车游戏的货币收入最终会成为对玩家自己的投资，也会成为玩家开下一局的动力。买更好的甲，能提升生存的可能性。买更好的子弹，提高击杀效率。枪械配件的硬核繁多，也正好给予玩家投资的窗口，好枪配好甲，读本不断升高，随后再进入游戏内进行博弈，此刻所打出游戏才真正达成闭环。几天体验下来，确实让我在结束测试之后有了一股没有按去端用完就浑身难受的感觉，可能难受的更多是删档前没把钱挥霍玩法。按区端游虽说是围绕搜打车玩法设计的游戏，虽然这类游戏在玩家群体中一直存在争议，但我多次体验下来，感觉游戏在搜打彻上的改进相比去年首爆时还是有明显的变化的。搜那是真的搜得到，我不太敢往屋子点跑，但就算是在郊外开开门乖乖游水，普通难度农场下来也能搜到1到2个斤。后来熟悉了去农场物资点跑刀也是没几把就出了个大金，打得过这个点可能又比较尴尬了。如果是野外碰到真人玩家，打得过的概率确实还挺高。但是要是碰到那种在资源点附近直接哐哐大脚步拉过来，基本就是在强化。举起六级全装的大佬，对于像我全身只够个门票钱的穷鬼来说，基本只能绕着他们打。所以目前游戏在地图设计上，要是你不想打，多半还是有退路的，直接你给鲁加友。但是要是输给了参与，那后果就要自己承受了。在撤离方面，现在游戏确实好车，我打了不下100局，也就只有一局是因为没控制好时间撤离失败，唯一一次撤离被狙击也是在敌方手雷的狂轰乱炸下幸存了下来。暗区端游还有许多利于玩家的小设计也十分不错。比如快速起装、快速配装、高亮对应物品等等。当然游戏。依然还有很多点需要改进，比如之前提到的脚步音效问题，游戏的优化还需进一步加强才能达到完美的水平。还有尽快上线全部麦和安全屋系统，听说之后还会有端游专属地图，也不晓得保不保真啊。游戏今天就已经正式上线了，大家正好可以乘着五一假期亲自验货，验证一下官方的九字箴言是否为真。而且官方还送了许多福利来让新手小白度过困难的学习期。就算不喜欢苏打车玩法，也可以试试按区中的团队镜技玩法，纯粹的对枪体验，考验的就是玩家的不基本功底了。本期视频到这里就结束了，喜欢的观众不要忘记关注加三连，我们下期再见。",

An upcoming multiplayer, extraction adventure, set in a lethal future earth, ravaged by a mysterious mechanized threat known as ARC.\nDoes anyone else think the Extraction genre is the next big thing in gaming? (Long read)\nThe Extraction genre has crazy growth potential.\nThe Extraction genre has limited growth potential.\nThe Extraction Shooter is gamings new \"Mario 64 moment\". A hack media outlet use this term on an Astro Bot Rescue Mission back in 2018. That milk is now chunky and black.\nAn Extraction Shooter is s a PvP RPG. The premise of the genre is building your characters power over a length of time. You do this buy \"extracting\" resources out of dangerous PvP centric lobbies that can in turn be crafted into better guns, gadgets, and ammo etc...\nHere's the reason why it's gamings new Mario 64 moment...\nThe top 10 best selling Atari (console) games are Pacman, Space Invaders, Asteroids, Missile Command, Donkey Kong, River Raid, Adventure, Combat, Football, and Pitfall. 10/10 of those games are session based games. Each session is relatively short, and plays nearly identical to the last. The only \"progression\" we see is from the players skill level improving.\nThe top 10 best selling NES (console) games are Mario 3, Mario 2, Zelda, Tetris, Metroid, Punch Out, Final Fantasy, The Adventure of Link, Castlevania, and Kirby's Adventure. Only 6/10 of those game are session based games. Zelda, Final Fantasy, The Adventures of Link, and Kirby's Adventure have a save system that allowed for a longer gameplay narrative.\nThe top 10 best selling PlayStation games are Gran Turismo, Gran Turismo 2, FF VII, GTA, Metal Gear Solid, Tekken 3, FF VIII, Spyro, Crash Bandicoot, and Crash Bandicoot 2. Only 1/10 of those games are session based games - Tekken 3. The trend is clear. We prefer long form narrative to session based games. Today, it's unheard of for a session based game to sell more than 10 million copies.\nHere's the top 10 most popular multiplayer games of today...\nFortnite - Session based. Roblox - Session based. CSGO - Session based. League of Legends - Session based. Valorant - Session based. Dota 2 - Session based. Warzone - Session based. PUBG - Session based. World of Warcraft - Long form FF XIV - Long form\nMultiplayer is in the transition period we saw between early 1980s Atari and the mid 1990s PlayStation. It took about 15 years to shift from mostly session based single player games to mostly long form single player games.\nThe Extraction Shooter genre is the best positioned to take us into the new era of multiplayer for two reasons. First, how many PvP genres lend themselves to long form narrative? The Extraction genre and the Survival genre? The industry seems to be pouring significantly more resources into making Extraction Shooters at the moment (ARC Raiders, PUBG Black Budget, Marathon, Exoborne, Far Cry Extraction, Warzone DMZ 2.0 etc...). Secondly, the genre is ripe for popularity growth because the objective is not to kill opposing players. The objective is to extract. This means that people who are interested in collecting, puzzle solving, exploring, socializing, and building are more likely to find their place in the genre. Bungies Marathon seems best suited to take the genre forward because of their production value advantage as well as the fact that they're targeting different types of players by making unique character classes. Thief and Stealth for example, aren't likely to be frontline CoD esque run and gun character classes.\nWhat say you? Marathon is videogames next Mario 64 moment?\nOpen comment sort options\nIt will never be the next big thing as long as Tarkies are running things. They leave no room for casuals or experimenting. Which is why the overall player base has stagnated.\nARC Raiders is for \"Tarkies\". It's for the masses.\nNot based on this sub. You would think this is strictly a pvp game with no pve experiences at all and no group activities.\ni loved the tech test because it was pvp with occasional grouping and risky grouping. that led to some fun and unique experiences. but the way people on this sub talk. they plan on just killing each other, which imo ruins what made this game feel unique.\nImagine not mentioning Tarkov\nI didn't mention any game in the genre because my focus was on the framework, not specific titles.\nWhat exactly does qualify as \"session based\"? I start the game, play a while and turn it off again?\nWhat about the best selling games of all time? Minecraft, GTA V, Ark: Survival Evolved, The Sims, Witcher 3, Red Dead Redemption 2....\nHell no, it doesn't to anything unique or groundbreaking to justify that. It doesn't even try to be innovative\nA \"session based\" game is one where the full loop ends in a single sitting.\nAn 8 minute Call of Duty match. A 20 minute Fortnite match. A 12 minute Gran Turismo 7 race.\nThe Extraction genre stretches out the full loop into something that resembles and RPG like Skyrim or Pokemon\nOne reason those games are so popular is that they are session-based. Everyone is on an even playing field when a session starts. Now, removing both of these aspects isn't going to make your game more popular, that's for sure. That's why I don't see extraction games as becoming the next big thing in gaming.\nLol no.... I'd say extractions are on their last leg and almost out,  I'd say battle royals are cooked, I'm expecting a new genre.\nVery interesting to hear someone think the genre is on it's last legs before the AAA wave of Extraction Shooters even begins lol\nNext two years will make your head spin.\nNaughty Dog tried it with TLOU Factions and got to a point that this kind of genre needs a high amount of service in the background and besides that none of the studios that had released an extrShooter has gotten THE formula to make everyone Happy, just look at Tarkov its in early access for nearly a DECADE now (8. years) and its still in finetuning.\nits really not that easy to handle the economy right to please active players and making it easy for new players to join a game without getting stumped by high tier players. theirs a few where it shines to look good... (Eft, Hunt, TCF, DnD and Insurgency S.) lets see whats happen after Arc is getting a second banger on consoles... yeah it could be a kick for ES games\nHunt: Showdown, AAA studio. Rainbow Six: Extraction, also AAA studio. CoD: Warzone DMZ also AAA studio. I'd say the AAA wave already started (and in some cases fizzled).\nAs someone who is playing Hunt Showdown for over 5 years now I am amused when people experienced the genre with Arc for the first time and are feeling that this is something new.\nThe genre is over a century old the problem is that all big companies fucked up big time in copying this genre. The biggest fault you can make is, to make it too casual. This genre HAS to be punishing. You need the fear of loosing something.\nHazard Zone was DOA and DMZ is a soulless shitshow compared to Tarkov or Hunt for example.\nSo it was about time that this genre gets another big hit. That this game is 3rd person will make it special, compared to the other great extraction shooters.\nNo offense to Hunt Showdown player but Hunt is barely an Extraction Shooter. It's almost a Battle Royale.\nEscape from Tarkov and ARC Raiders exemplify the genres potential significantly more than Hunt for a multitude of reasons.\ni think these extraction shooters still pretty heavily reseble session based games. you are not living in that world, you just take part in these scavenging sessions to level up your character. i think sandbox style games like rust is where we see the next big thing.\nI can guarantee there were a number of market analysts who said Extraction Shooters are the next big thing some years ago. That's why we're starting to see more, now that dev cycles are finishing.\nDifference is that AAA developers are now getting their first Extraction Shooters out today. The genre has been relegated to indie developers who lack funding up to this point\nI think extraction shooters benefit from lacking one thing that most modern shooters have, skill based matchmaking. Not having skill based matchmaking already makes the game feel a lot better to play because you actually feel rewarded for getting better.\nFortnite was fun when it first came out but due to the introduction of SBMM it became a sweatfest and it got old. Same with CoD, we all loved the old CoD's which coincidently had no SBMM.\nActually, SBMM has been studied extensively in the industry. It's only included to help the player base to have more fun matches.\nThose against it are the types who want to play basketball as an able bodied person against women's wheelchair players.\nIf you find crushing inferior opponents fun, you're a weirdo lol\nSince there is waaayyy much action and fear to loose, the thrill will be the next dopamin hook for a lot of people. They allways greed for fear and action, this is the Best way currently\nIm not read your essay but I think arc raiders will change the entire genre. Current state of genre really excited and people want to try bu most of games are not well polished or balanced even eft\nFortnite: Free to play, Roblox: Free to play, CSGO: Free to play, League of Legends: Free to play, Valorant: Free to Play, DOTA2: Free to play, Warzone: Free to play, PUBG: Free to play...\nYour answer might be more the cost of entry than they are session based games.\nnot rly .. they all make the same stupid mistakes, if its extraction looter than make that the core gameplay.\nreality is most add some marked etc, than its just some arena shooter with extra steps cause everyone just buys BIS instead of self found items .\nlooking at tarkov, dark n darker .. they all made this stupid mistake and are no more fun to me.\nnot having clearly defined session goals beyond extracting means a session can feel like a win just for experiencing some crazy shit and a few close gunfights without dying\ni want embark to lean more into player choice and consequences\nadd reputation system > (speranza or exiles)\nmaybe youre blood thirsty. you just want the best weps and gear to pvp. but this bloodthirst means speranza hates you (for killing in range of elevators) and wont let you come back, so you cant use their trading services with players. now you have to live in \"exile\" camps. nobody brings you back when you die in raid, youre either broke nearly dead in your solo shack starting a raid again or do the after-death PvE re-gearing missions like the tutorial\nmaybe youre a horder , or a trader. not using the best gear but instead limiting yourself to cheap loadouts for max gain and minimal loss, and selling or trading gear to other people\nmaybe you could focus on creating/sourcing excess medical supplies that donating to speranza would give you experience boosts and temporarily bring the supply costs down for players to buy from traders\nmaybe youre weird, and just wanna get into gunfights with people then defibb them to see if theyll fight with you after\nemote options for squads to temporarily reveal positions or overhead names to each other if you link up in game\nThe genre has a lot of potential...but it probably won't be reached.\nExtractions shooters(ES), the ones chock full of all the new stuff people want, are resource hungry beasts that need a lot of time and work to develop. With indie ES like \"Hell is Others\", \"Zero Sievert\", or \"No Escape from Madness\" really pull back on the number of features specifically because they just can't match what big budget publishers can pump into a title, and rather focus on some core mechanics their developers liked. Usually a PvE-focused aspect.\nDoes this mean look to big publishers to make something good? Nope. A lot of them are very risk averse, and would rather just copy each other's formula when making their own ES with one or two tweaks to make theirs look more interesting, all to trap players in a dopamine drip to keep coming back.\ntl:dr the teams that can make a real difference lack the resources to do it, and the teams that do are subservient to managers who barely understand games and don't want to take a gamble on innovative ideas. ARC Raiders is a lightning in a bottle situation that is pushing the boundaries just enough that their publishers aren't getting cold feet but still innovative enough to stand out from previous titles. There's still a lot of room to grow though; and I honestly don't know if we'll see it before the big publishing companies move on to the next big thing.\nReddit, Inc. © 2025.

      "content": "Insights / Perspectives / Evolving the Extraction Genre: A Brief Roadmap to Achieving Greater Adoption\nWRITTEN BY:\nMustafa Kamal\nInvestor, Galaxy Interactive\nTOPICS\nInteractive\nWeb3\nPERSPECTIVES • FEBRUARY 25, 2025\nEvolving the Extraction Genre: A Brief Roadmap to Achieving Greater Adoption\nThe extraction genre is all about engaging in a high-stakes environment where the goal is not just survival, but the pursuit of acquiring and extracting valuable loot, all while balancing the risk of potentially losing it all. The genre has its roots in survival and looter-shooter titles - games such as DayZ and Rust paved the way by introducing mechanics and gameplay loops centered around risk and reward. Extraction titles introduced greater intensity and thrive on gameplay loops that reinforce a special blend of thrilling action, constant tension, and hard-earned rewards.\nWhat makes the genre special is also what makes it niche; and therein lies the challenge with expanding the genre for greater player adoption. Some of the current barriers that we hope to eliminate include:\nOverwhelming Gameplay Systems and Limited Accessibility:\nExtraction games often assume that players have a level of familiarity/comfort with complex mechanics, inventory management systems, and map navigation. For newcomers, this can feel overwhelming. The fear of losing everything—whether loot or progress—can be paralyzing, especially for players unfamiliar with such unforgiving systems.\nStress-Inducing Gameplay:\nThe very tension that makes extraction games exhilarating can also make them stressful. Prolonged high-stakes encounters, combined with the fear of permadeath or other loss of progress, can lead to burnout. It becomes difficult to sustain that level of intensity over longer gaming sessions and makes an even tougher sell to convince friends to play with each other (everyone is required to commit to that same intensity level).\nUnpredictable Player Behavior and Toxicity:\nIn general, competitive games tend to bring out more aggressive player behavior. It’s natural to want to win and flex on others! However, in ultra-intense extraction games it can act as a deterrent to newcomers or less skilled players. It can act as a point of churn before they’ve even had a chance to experience what the genre has to offer.\nTime Commitment:\nExtraction games frequently require extended sessions to achieve meaningful progress, making them less appealing to players with limited time to invest.\nDespite these current roadblocks, we believe players deserve to experience the thrill of extraction without the intensity or burnout that comes from existing offerings. A quick search on reddit exemplifies the large gap that exists within the market today:\nEscape from Tarkov (2016) and Hunt: Showdown (2019) are two popular titles that have become synonymous with the genre itself. New entrants such as Dark and Darker have gained traction by introducing a unique twist through its world setting and mechanics.\nThe growing demand for extraction games is clear. However, to elevate the genre and increase its appeal to a larger audience, new entrants should seek to broaden the scope beyond existing games toward one which blends greater gameplay accessibility and meta progression systems that have been popularized by other genres. This is not about diluting the genre and stripping it of what makes it special, rather it’s about repackaging the overall user experience into something more presentable.\nFlipping the previous list, this includes making the following changes to make it more appealing for newcomers:\nStreamlined Onboarding: The first-time user experience (FTUE) should use well-crafted PvE (player versus environment) level design to serve as a low-stakes environment that teaches players core mechanics of the genre. Everyone can learn at their own pace without the risk of immediately jumping into a competitive PvP (player versus player) lobby that requires one to figure everything out on their own.\nRe-balancing the Risk-Reward Loop: Introducing new mechanisms that give players an option to insure their loot (part or in full) and gameplay systems that enable partial rewards for failed extractions. This allows players to participate in the thrill of risking their inventory without being paralyzed at the thought of potentially losing it all.\nEnforcing Community Safeguards: Influencing player behavior through cooperative objectives or team-based modes can align player incentives and help reduce toxicity amongst the player community.\nFlexible Time Commitments: Game modes, objectives, and extraction zones that provide varied session lengths to accommodate players with changing schedules.\nLooking Toward the Future of Extraction\nThe future of the genre lies in its ability to evolve without losing its soul. If these innovators succeed, extraction games may no longer be defined by their barriers, but by their boundless potential to captivate and thrill a new generation of players.\nAt Galaxy Interactive, we are dedicated to supporting visionary founders and companies that not only pioneer new genres but also redefine existing ones to inspire and engage a new generation of players. Our investments in Elodie Games and Notorious Studios reflect this commitment. Both companies are revolutionizing the appeal of extraction games, striving to make them accessible and enjoyable for seasoned enthusiasts and curious newcomers alike. By reimagining core mechanics, enhancing social systems, and refining gameplay pacing, they are leading the evolution of extraction-based gaming into an exciting new era.\nLegal Disclosure:\nThis document, and the information contained herein, has been provided to you by Galaxy Digital Inc. and its affiliates (“Galaxy Digital”) solely for informational purposes.

      "content": "45\nvotes\nWhat defines an extraction shooter, and why does the gaming community generally dislike it?\nPosted April 30 by Flashfall\nTags: ask.discussion, video games, genres, multiplayer, pvp, bungie, marathon, shooters.extraction, escape from tarkov, arc raiders, hunt showdown, battlestate games, crytek, embark studios\nMessage for Deimos or anyone else on Tildes development\nI'm putting this here after writing the rest of my post, but could we please get an \"expand edit window\" option, unless there is one and I'm blind? The preview window's great but the edit window's locked to 6 lines and I would appreciate some more since it would make editing a long post like this much easier. Thanks.\nThe actual post\nThere has been a lot of gaming buzz regarding extraction shooters as of late, with the closed alpha of Bungie's Marathon currently underway, the second tech test of Embark Studio's ARC Raiders starting just now, and the recent news of the cancellation of a Titanfall extraction shooter from EA/Respawn. As someone who's played and enjoyed extraction shooters before I've been following these and observing the discourse surrounding them (except the Titanfall one, I didn't even know that was a thing til the news of its cancellation) and I've been somewhat dismayed to see a lot of confusion, mixed messaging, and general disdain for the genre. So I've decided to put my own thoughts and definitions of it down here, and clear up the most common misconceptions or falsehoods I've seen repeated ad nauseam elsewhere.\nA brief introduction to extraction shooters\nFirst off, what IS an extraction shooter, what makes it different from other shooters, notably battle royales, and which games qualify as extraction shooters? An extraction shooter, as its core gameplay loop, is a shooter where you enter a map with loot and AI enemies scattered about, and the goal is to gather loot and extract from the map with it. However, you need to get out alive - should you die, you will lose everything (with some exceptions) in your inventory, including the gear you went in with. On top of that, the most popular and successful extraction shooters are PvEvP - you will be competing with other real players for loot, and taking loot off their bodies can be just as profitable if not more so than taking it from PvE enemies. It is optional though, and it is entirely viable to play as a \"rat\", sneaking around and gathering loot without drawing attention and extracting without anyone noticing.\nNot a battle royale\nExtraction shooters are also frequently confused with battle royales as both games have players inserted into a PvP map where they scavenge gear. However, the similarities more or less end there. With battle royales, you do not risk losing your items on death as all players are dropped in with nothing and don't have a stash to draw from or store items in, so any \"loot\" found is merely a means of securing victory for the current round. PvP is also mandatory, as the goal is not to get loot but to be the last team/person standing. To facilitate this in a timely manner, battle royales have a shrinking map mechanic that forces the remaining players into a smaller playable area as time goes on to force them into a confrontation. Extraction shooters do not force PvP or have shrinking maps but do have their own ways of drawing players towards each other, through loot-rich points of interest and extraction zones. Some parts of the map will have greater quality and/or quantity of loot, which will naturally draw players in, and there are a few designated areas where you can actually leave with your loot which will also increase your odds of encountering other players either trying to take your loot before you can leave, or trying to leave themselves. Because it is not forced though, PvP encounters are a much more unpredictable and organic experience in extraction shooters.\nWhat extraction shooters are out there?\nSo which games count as extraction shooters? The current leaders in the genre, which also happen to be some of the longest-lasting ones, are Escape From Tarkov (EFT) and Hunt: Showdown. EFT is a rather hardcore modern military FPS with a heavy focus on realism - guns are extremely customizable, ammo types and armor can make a huge difference, bullets are extremely lethal even from AI enemies, and a good headshot will drop even the most geared and armored player so there's always risk. It has a cult following but its hardcore emphasis makes it unapproachable for most. It also has periodic progression wipes where players have to start over from scratch to keep things fresh and more fair for newcomers, but is a major turnoff for players that don't like to lose what they've earned. Hunt is an FPS set at the end of the 19th century with a bit of dark magic/voodoo theme. Guns are reflective of the times and rather limited in terms of rate of fire and reload speed, which results in more drawn-out firefights where every bullet counts. For each round, the focus isn't to get loot around the map but rather to track and hunt down a bounty boss monster, then extract with that bounty. These two games are what will come to mind first when extraction shooters are mentioned, EFT more so.\nI won't go over cancelled (Titanfall), discontinued (The Cycle: Frontier), or side game-mode (The Division's dark zone/survival) extraction shooters here, which is basically almost all of them sadly, so I'll talk about the two biggest up-and-coming ones instead, Marathon and ARC Raiders.\nMarathon and the surrounding controversy\nMarathon is a sci-fi FPS that uses the lore of Bungie's Marathon trilogy from the 90's as its setting. You play as a \"runner\" in a robotic shell scavenging the remains of the colony on Tau Ceti IV for scrap to fulfill contracts for the megacorporations involved in the colony's development who now seek to find out what went wrong. It checks the usual boxes for an extraction shooter - you go in with your own loadout, scavenge at points of interest to fill your limited inventory, defeat PvE enemies and other runners for loot opportunities, and try to extract alive before time's up. There are a couple things of note that have resulted in mixed opinions:\nThe art direction for runners, gear, and architecture is a sort of mass-produced, neon-colored, smoothed plastic, blocky style, which is a \"love it or hate it\" kind of thing.\nThe gunplay is very similar to that of Destiny, Bungie's last game, which in my opinion is very solid. However, they did make the decision to have mouse magnetism enabled for PC (your cursor will magnetize to targets) to give it more parity with console players, and that has been very unpopular.\nThe only queueing option is teams of 3 and the devs have stood their ground on not having a solo or duo player queue, which is a turn-off for players that prefer solo, or don't want to play with randoms and don't have 2 friends to play with.\nPlayers do not have full customization of their runners but must choose from 6 runner archetypes that have a set of abilities and a specific look, which can be partially changed with a skin. This is also largely unpopular, as Bungie's past titles have featured high levels of cosmetic customization and this feels largely restrictive and monetization-focused instead.\nThere is no option for proximity voice chat, which the devs have said was excluded to protect players from toxicity. This has also proved to be very unpopular.\nIt will have seasonal progression wipes which will reset faction reputation and clean out player vaults, which is unpopular among players that like to hoard their loot, especially many Destiny players.\nSupposedly there will be more \"raid-like\" PvE experiences on an as-of-yet unreleased map that takes place aboard the Marathon colony ship, but how mechanically complex those are or whether or not that will be enough to attract PvE-oriented players is pure speculation at this point.\nIt will not be free-to-play, but rather released at a \"premium\" but not full game price point, which most people are assuming to be $40 USD.\nThe game is set to release in September this year, but based on the feedback Bungie is getting from players in this very first alpha, they will need to take this feedback very seriously and make a number of changes in the few months they have left, or risk a very rocky release and potentially financial failure. Many players seem to want Marathon and Bungie to fail, notably vitriolic Destiny veterans that feel like they were snubbed out of Destiny 3 for this, but as someone with over 2000 hours in Destiny 2 myself I want it to succeed, whether I play it or not. I'd rather there be more fun and successful games than major failures, and wishing for something to fail just because it isn't what you want is incredibly petty.\nARC Raiders, the underdog\nARC Raiders is a third person shooter set in a post-apocalypse where robots called ARC have devastated the surface of Earth and humanity has retreated underground, sending \"raiders\" to the surface to scavenge for tech and goods. It's developed by Embark Studios, which is made up of ex-DICE (Battlefield) developers, and their other title is the well-received but niche PvP shooter The Finals. Mechanics-wise, there isn't anything particularly unique about this extraction shooter - limited mobility, limited inventory space, PvE enemies, points of interest, extraction points, etc. However, it seems to check all the boxes of what players want and it does it well while making the experience more casual and accessible:\nThere are \"safe pockets\" where players can store a few loot items they won't lose on death (Tarkov does also have this, Marathon and Hunt do not).\nThere is proximity voice, and also a quick emote menu for giving vocal commands, directions, and responses.\nThe art direction is realistic post-apocalypse with high graphical fidelity and semi-futuristic robots, which is \"safe\", but still good looking.\nThe audio design is phenomenal. Distant gunfire, supersonic cracks of rounds, bullets ricocheting off surfaces, large bots stomping around from blocks away, player footsteps on different surfaces and within enclosed spaces, quadcopter drones buzzing, larger bots with unsettling and deep \"roars\", and more.\nThere isn't a solo or duo-only queue, but there is solo-matching priority at least, so you're more likely to be placed with other solo players.\nThere is a clear progression path in the form of a workshop you can upgrade with scavenged materials, and a deep skill tree with multiple branches.\nRaiders are not class or hero-based and are freely customizable by the players in terms of loadout and appearance.\nChaff PvE enemies are relatively easy to defeat but still dangerous. Aside from eliminating them as threats, they can drop materials or items to recharge your shields so they're not just a waste of ammo. Non-chaff PvE enemies can be significantly more dangerous and harder to defeat but will have valuable loot.\nThere is already an example of a PvE \"boss\" robot guarding a point of interest which requires some mechanics to collect the loot within it. The boss itself is very challenging to defeat, even with multiple teams fighting it, but should reward top-tier loot.\nWhile the game was initially announced as free-to-play, the devs have since switched to selling it at at $40 USD.\nThere are \"battle passes\" in the game in the form of shops players can unlock using a currency that is earnable in-game, or purchased with real money (like warbonds from Helldivers 2 for any helldivers reading this).\nOverall, the game is shaping up to be a more accessible extraction shooter for the wider gaming audience and very serious competition for Marathon. No official release date has been announced but they are planning on releasing some time this year.\nThe stigma around extraction shooters\nI've mentioned various things about extraction shooters that may be contributing to their unpopularity amongst the wider gaming audience throughout the post, but for the sake of cohesiveness and for all the folks that just want a TL;DR, I will collate and expand on those ideas here:\nConfusion with battle royales - I've seen some people confuse extraction shooters with battle royales and say \"the market is oversaturated with extraction shooters, dead trend chasing game\" or something along those lines. It's hard to call a market oversaturated when there's only 2 successful and very niche games in it, but if you incorrectly lump all the battle royales in that makes more sense.\nEscape From Tarkov is a bad poster child - When people do think of extraction shooters (and not mistakenly battle royales), they will default to EFT, which is notoriously hardcore and \"sweaty\". It would be the same as never having played an RPG, and being introduced to it with Dark Souls, which would understandably turn away anyone that isn't looking for that kind of experience.\nPvP and losing progress - The game always having a PvP element is already discouraging to PvE-focused players, and this is only made worse by the chance to lose your gear if you die. Many players are strongly opposed to losing progress, and losing multiple times in a row due to other players defeating them when they just want to do PvE and get some loot is an awful experience that they don't have to have in a different type of game.\nProgression wipes are anathema to hoarders - On top of potentially losing progress on a round-to-round basis, seasonal progression wipes also threaten to reset progress entirely between seasons, While they are effective at keeping things fresh, players that like to have 400+ items stored away in their vault that they will never use and just admire from time to time revile this concept. Less hoard-minded players may be concerned about their potential inability to max out their progression, the fear of missing out induced by temporary progression, or the pointlessness of even progressing if it gets wiped anyway.\nI didn't read any of that, are extraction shooters for me or not?\nWell, that depends. If you:\nDon't mind or enjoy a mixed PvEvP experience\nAre ok with the idea of loot and progression being temporary\nLike the higher stakes of potentially losing your inventory and gear, or taking someone else's\nAre ok with inventory management, even in the middle of a round\nAre not terrible at shooters\nThen yes, extraction shooters may be fun for you! They certainly aren't for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with not enjoying one or the genre in general, but if you do, they offer a very unique gaming experience. If you are interested, keep an eye on ARC Raiders and Marathon - they aim to be more accessible than previous extraction shooters and it's a lot easier to get in on a new game than join one with a veteran playerbase.\n39 comments\nCollapse replies\nExpand all\nComments sorted by\nmost votes\nnewest first\norder posted\nrelevance\nkfwyre\nMay 1\nLink\nThis is a such phenomenal, high-effort post. We can’t exemplary topics on the site, so consider this comment to be its own label for your words. Imagine that they now have a lovely blue stripe next to them. They deserve it!\nI’m someone who has heard the term “extraction shooter” before but genuinely had no idea what it actually meant. Your explanation was incredibly informative and did a fantastic job of giving me the full picture. You didn’t just define the genre in the abstract; you gave details about specific games and tied all your information in to the wider cultural context and perception of the genre.\nBravo! I learned a lot from your post. Thank you for taking the time to write all this out for us.\n28 votes\nPepetto\nMay 1\n(edited May 1)\nLink\nI'd like to support the confusion between battle royal and extraction shooter. They share enough in common (spawn, gather loot, fight players, steal loot) that it's perfectly reasonable for most people to lump them together (extraction shooter is a battle royal where the map doesn't shrinks). It's like claiming gala and boscop apple are not both just apples. You are allowed to like one and not the other, but you shouldn't complain that they are lumped together by most people when most people don't care about the nuance between them.\nOf course, thank you for the high effort post anyway, it was fun reading about your special interest and you explained your point of view very clearly.\n15 votes\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nI suppose the most important difference between a battle royale and an extraction shooter isn't what they do with the loot or maps, but the \"win\" condition for each, the end goal for the player. Battle royales are all about being the last one standing and claiming victory over others, while extraction shooters are about surviving and increasing your wealth and growth. To borrow your apple analogy, one is an eating apple and the other is a cider apple. They're both apples, but they have different ways of being enjoyed which can't be discerned from just looking at them.\n9 votes\nEji1700\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nIt's hard to explain to people because permadeath/gameover as a genre mechanic is mostly frowned upon, but if you've ever played any traditional crawl style game, it's basically that same rush of 'oh man i've really gotten this character off the ground' or 'wow I can now reliably get started without being terrified of every corner'.\nIt's a really fun experience, but it starts with learning to lose, and realizing that the game is designed around it, and it's not the end of the world. If you can trust the system and give it a shot, these things can often wind up super fun.\nUnfortunately the naturally competitive nature extraction shooters bring to the mix can make it extra rough, as \"oh i screwed up and should've run from that ogre\" in crawl is your fault, but \"This guy knows some line that I had no idea existed and smoked me\" feels so much worse.\n5 votes\nAkir\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nThis is the reason why I don’t find multiplayer shooters to be fun. Multiplayer games are only really fun if you’re on the same level, but with shooters you have an advantage if you are extremely familiar with the map. You can become competitive by playing a lot until you know all the “tricks”, but that’s a major time investment that would require you to suffer a lot of losses before you can even dream of getting there.\n1 vote\nEji1700\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nI think onboarding players to the higher levels is something games should put more focus on, with training that's teaching you what the better players are doing and better replay analysis. That said we do live in an age where learning these things even through the internet is easier than it ever was.\nStill, I get your point, and it's why I've been keeping a huge eye on Due Process, which is akin to R6 Siege. Maps are procedurally generated each game. They have consistent things about them (banks will have a vault, security, foyer, etc), but there's enough randomness every game that it's not just \"oh i watched a pro play and now I know about this gap here, here, and here that covers most of your angles\" because the rooms will have different layouts/sizes/walls/etc.\nIt seems to have nailed the map proc gen sweet spot for the genre and I hope we see it more moving forward.\nThat said I do think a huge part of an extraction shooter is learning the map (it's the progression you keep when you die) so I don't know if it's a perfect match for that genre.\n3 votes\nEji1700\nApril 30\n(edited April 30)\nLink\nI've been keeping my eye on all this so thanks for the great breakdown. I liked hunt but didn't love that later in the game the NPC's were mostly a joke and the weapons eventually kinda got around the expected downsides of clunky loud things with long reload and HIGH commitment.\nI'm VERY keen for marathon (which will be it's own post) so I'll mostly comment on that:\nThe art direction for runners, gear, and architecture is a sort of mass-produced, neon-colored, smoothed plastic, blocky style, which is a \"love it or hate it\" kind of thing.\nPersonally love it. I don't love the 'loud' runner aesthetic that's been popular in games like apex legend, where everyone looks like they're trying to be an influencer, but so far only one of them leans hard on that, and the rest of it I adore. This comes from a huge fan of the older marathon games, and I really think this style 'fits' for lots of clever reasons, but I'm not sure if anyone will care enough for it to stick.\nThe gunplay is very similar to that of Destiny, Bungie's last game, which in my opinion is very solid. However, they did make the decision to have mouse magnetism enabled for PC (your cursor will magnetize to targets) to give it more parity with console players, and that has been very unpopular.\nI'm not in the alpha, so can only speak from watching others play, but it seems a lot better than that? One of my favorite decisions for marathon so far has been \"guns are guns\". There's no uber rare version with X ammo that reaps through beginners and only eventually kills good players. The TTK seems to be in that perfect sweet spot of \"always be careful because you can be dropped\" but not \"oh god i got jumped and died instantly\". In comparison I felt that destiny was EXTREMELY RPG heavy, where actual gunplay matters less than gear, and Apex felt very very slow.\nThe only queueing option is teams of 3 and the devs have stood their ground on not having a solo or duo player queue, which is a turn-off for players that prefer solo, or don't want to play with randoms and don't have 2 friends to play with.\nI'm mixed on this, but also hopeful that part of the reason will revolve around what's going to happen with the raid like mechanics.\nPlayers do not have full customization of their runners but must choose from 6 runner archetypes that have a set of abilities and a specific look, which can be partially changed with a skin. This is also largely unpopular, as Bungie's past titles have featured high levels of cosmetic customization and this feels largely restrictive and monetization-focused instead.\nI'm not sure if you mean just aesthetic customization, but from what i've seen a TON of your \"build\" comes from gold mods that you find on runs which will modify how your runner plays pretty extensively. Stuff like have a second jump, run faster with knife out, etc. Both generic and specific to certain kinds of runners. The footage i'm seeing most people say they're currently decently generous with this stuff, to the point players have 2 or 3 backup kits of gold mods for their various runners.\nThere is no option for proximity voice chat, which the devs have said was excluded to protect players from toxicity. This has also proved to be very unpopular.\nSaw something today where I guess the devs said they're going to try to get it added, and the main issues now are just overcoming technical and legal hurdles.\nIt will have seasonal progression wipes which will reset faction reputation and clean out player vaults, which is unpopular among players that like to hoard their loot, especially many Destiny players.\nConversely I think this is the way to go. Again I like that it's not just about who has been grinding the most. When these games become second jobs to even pretend to have an even playing field it's brutal.\nSupposedly there will be more \"raid-like\" PvE experiences on an as-of-yet unreleased map that takes place aboard the Marathon colony ship, but how mechanically complex those are or whether or not that will be enough to attract PvE-oriented players is pure speculation at this point.\nI think this is going to be the big \"selling point\" for a lot of people. Marathon has a HISTORY with its story telling and they're currently alluding to a lot and showing nothing of what people like me have been waiting for. It is confirmed that aliens are in the game, so I'm hoping that despite all previous games (halo and destiny) they'll somehow stay true to the original Marathon vibe of \"dear god you're just the biggest ant on the anthill\" level of scope. I'm assuming that might be why the 3 man requirement, and am hoping they managed to do something unique in the genre, rather than just \"another extraction shooter\" (Which is currently looks to be, but does look like the only one I'd put time on even now).\nIt will not be free-to-play, but rather released at a \"premium\" but not full game price point, which most people are assuming to be $40 USD.\nI, mostly, prefer this. As always depends on how they monetize down the line, but F2P almost always translates to predatory tactics, often backed by selling power.\nMessage for Deimos or anyone else on Tildes development\nI'm putting this here after writing the rest of my post, but could we please get an \"expand edit window\" option, unless there is one and I'm blind? The preview window's great but the edit window's locked to 6 lines and I would appreciate some more since it would make editing a long post like this much easier. Thanks.\nSeconded. I'd love a slightly more robust editor for longer posts. Right now I just bash them out in vscode/helix as a .md and copy them over if I'm doing anything serious, but I don't NEED all that power, just a few additions. It would have made responding to this post cleanly much easier as well. Expanding the reply edit window has to be done carefully so you don't drag the control off the edge of the window. Which means dragging down, scrolling to the new bottom, repeat 3 or 4x. I'd also kill to have the preview window just next to the reply window (much like RES), as it makes making high quality posts so much easier when you can quickly see what markdown mistakes you've made.\nLike say the 4 i made in this by not putting another linebreak between the quotes...i fixed them before posting, but it's annoying to have to hope to preview, then hop back, then scroll through and find where you screwed up, and repeat.\n6 votes\ncrashb\nMay 1\nLink\nThank you for the post!\nTarkov is enthralling, but I can’t ever bring myself to go back. The game was already pay-to-win (paying more money grants the player a bigger stash and safe container) but they recently added a $500 “Unheard” edition that lets owners move freely past AI enemies. On top of that, an infamous video confirmed the presence of at least one cheater in ~60% of all game lobbies, completely killing my motivation to play. It makes sense; since you’re risking a loadout each time you play a match, the incentive to cheat is very high.\nThe Cycle: Frontier also dealt quite heavily with cheaters, and even formed a dedicated anti-cheat team during the early days of its first season. They did a lot right, and even let players generate the premium currency for free by building a base upgrade. For whatever reason, the game never found its footing, and fizzled out after Season 3.\nHunt: Showdown has achieved success by diluting Tarkov’s formula; dying in Hunt doesn’t really set you back. To me, though, the risk is what’s compelling about an extraction shooter – hopefully Marathon can strike a better balance.\n5 votes\nEji1700\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nThanks for a link to that video. It's fascinating.\nAs cheating gets more extreme, i'm wondering if we'll finally see more devs trying to \"honeypot\" cheaters. Something like completely invisible characters who can only be picked up by cheat software that thinks there's something there. How you'd accomplish that without the cheat engine knowing that's what's going on is probably difficult, if not impossible, but it'd be a lovely way to help flag suspicious play for review by humans.\nI really think more and more these competitive games are going to have to be built from the ground up with an anticheat framework in mind. Much like how a modern fighting game MUST have rollback netcode for anyone to take it seriously, other genre's are going to have to start treating anticheat as a core system functionality with a suite of built in tools designed specifically for it, rather than \"oh yeah here's the basics and we'll just patch on later\".\n1 vote\npekt\nMay 2\nLink\nParent\nI hadn't heard of the Unheard edition, just sad to see them continually going down the pay to win route.\nI played Tarkov on and off for a year during covid and felt like I got my money's worth, and even then with the base game it felt like buying the high tier edition for the better case would have been worth it for how many hours I was getting out of the game. It was great playing with friends and learning the maps. I felt like if it had come out during high school, I would have spent all my time playing that instead of League of Legends.\nI like the genre and would love to play it more, but don't have the time or a computer that would run it well anymore. They released a co-op mode, which would be the only way I'd probably play it after my friends had told me how fun the single player mod that was popular can be.\narchevel\nMay 1\nLink\nI was unfamiliar with the term \"extraction shooter\", but aside from the PvP part Deep Rock Galactic seem to fit the bill quite well (at least my memory of it from 3-4? years ago). The premise in that game is that you are a space dwarf and you go down to a planet to extract ores while attacked by local fauna and complete missions. The missions can be things like defend a drill from enemy onslaughts, find and kill a particular bug etc. etc. From my recollection it was fairly high paced, but at the time there was no PvP. The game was a coop shooter where people could play different classes with somewhat unique abilities and play styles. After each mission you brought home loot and could spend it on various upgrades.\nWould DRG be considered an extraction shooter or something else?\n3 votes\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nDRG would not be considered an extraction shooter as one of the defining features of an extraction shooter is the increased stakes of losing the gear you bring with you on a round if you lose, not just the loot you find. DRG also lacks lootable equipment on its maps, as equipment is limited to the loadout you choose at the start of a round, which you cannot lose. DRG would be considered a class-based co-op FPS.\n8 votes\nCarrow\nApril 30\nLink\nI've tried Helldivers 2 and Dark and Darker, neither of which really fully qualifies as an extraction shooter, but didn't enjoy either. Dark and Darker was unfun bc I'd typically get merced by someone before I can see them even when trying to rat. I didn't give Helldivers 2 much a chance because I refunded it as soon as I saw a battle pass in a game I already paid for. I was bored with the first several missions though.\nI'd like to enjoy one, I play a wide variety of genres, but the market hasn't revealed one for me yet. ARC is a non-starter with a battle pass on top of the initial price, Marathon is a non-starter since Bungie bans Linux players. I look forward to the genre's growth if it can escape battle passes.\n2 votes\nTheJorro\nApril 30\nLink\nParent\nHelldivers 2 is considered to be the gold standard for including battlepasses because additional purchases aren't necessary at all. The rates of earning in-game credits to buy new ones is very reasonable to the point that additional purchases are really just paying for time-skips. I can't think of any other game that comes close to having battlepasses be so reasonable.\nBut also if Destiny is any indication, then Marathon should be right out. Those games had some of the worst MTX schemes out there, worse than battlepasses.\n9 votes\nCptBluebear\nApril 30\nLink\nParent\nCrucially, Helldivers' battle pass does not expire. They are perpetually available and unlockable whenever you choose.\nGenerally, just playing the game semi-regularly allows you to keep up to date with new releases without paying. That's how generous the ingame currency earnings are.\nIt's the least predatory battle pass out there.\n@Flashfall they have or are addressing the slowly rotating shop. Arrowhead agreed the shop became too large for such a low quantity long duration rotation. I remember reading something about this right around the Killzone collab.\n5 votes\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nApril 30\nLink\nParent\nAgree with the battle passes in Helldivers and also the monetization from Bungie. I've purchased multiple expansions and season passes for Destiny 2 and while I don't regret my purchases since I had a great time with friends, Bungie really does continually push its players into buying more content, and then they had to go and take a sledgehammer to their community's trust by even removing some of that paid content from the game. I'm not optimistic about Marathon's monetization at all, but I think ARC Raiders will manage it nicely if they emulate Helldivers (except for the very small rotating window of cosmetics ugh, why make some things unavailable for months or more?).\n1 vote\nPromonk\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\n... why make some things unavailable for months or more?\nFOMO drives sales. It's slightly less duplicitous than premium currency bundles with just less than you need for the skin or whatever you want. Both of these tactics are being considered for regulation in the EU, so here's hoping.\n2 votes\nEsteeBestee\nMay 1\nLink\nIn theory, I want to like extraction shooters, but every one I've played, I've felt a little directionless due to the lack of an overall goal or being able to \"win\" a match. I recognize this is a me problem. I'm hoping that Marathon can grab me possibly with the yet to be revealed maps. I did get into the alpha and I think the base gameplay is very solid, I do love the aesthetics and presentation of the game, but the issue I was running into is that my teammates would NEVER communicate. It was frustrating having a contract to go to x zone on the map, but your teammates won't talk to coordinate so you don't know where they have to go, they might have to go across the map, and then suddenly you're either split up or you just don't do your objective that match. I found that part pretty frustrating, which is a shame because the fights were fun! For me personally, this game will ride or die on how good the narrative, the \"raid like\" experience is on the Marathon map, the lore, etc. I'm a HUUUUUUGE Destiny fan, so I'm hoping it can tap into that a bit, but I accept that it probably won't (and I certainly don't blame Marathon for Destiny's current state, in fact I do want Marathon to be successful regardless if I like it or not).\nI did see Arc Raiders yesterday and signed up to be in the test, I'd like to try that out. I liked the look of it, but it's impossible to know if I'd like it before playing.\nIn the conversation on solo queue vs not solo queue, I'm very split. On one hand, allowing solos can attract more players to the game and I personally like solo queue for times where I only have an hour to play and I'm kinda stressed and don't want to talk to people. On the other hand, designing a game to work for both solo queue and trios could be kind of hard and I can understand how a developer might not want to compromise the group play experience for solos. One of my main thoughts during the Marathon alpha was that \"if this game came out in like 2009 when everyone still used microphones in games, this would be crazy\". Some of my best experiences in Destiny 2 have been from raiding with strangers and people actually using their microphones. I think I would have a lot more fun with Marathon if people did. This is also fixed if I have friends to play with, but I was the only one I know that got into the alpha (out of my 50 or so destiny friends) and who knows how many will buy the game when it comes out.\n2 votes\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nIn regards to Marathon's closed alpha, I will say that while Bungie has a strong core combat system and an interesting established setting to potentially do great things with, they've stumbled a lot in communicating their intentions to both their fans and curious observers alike. It seems like they've sorely overlooked many major social aspects that would bolster a multiplayer PvP game of this nature, like lack of proximity chat making communication with both your team and potentially other teams very difficult, more conservative cosmetic options making self-expression limited, no social hub or personal space for runners to mingle or just casually idle in, and no PvE events that really require team cohesion at this time. They can say how Marathon truly shines in the 3rd and 4th maps with the raid-like events all they like, but none of that is actually being exposed to or experienced by their potential playerbase, and as such they can only react to what they've been given, which is not nearly enough to drum up new hype or hold interest for long. Bungie loves keeping secrets for players to stumble upon organically but that's only going to work if there are enough players to sustain the game long enough for said secrets to be found. They cannot afford to pull punches in their current state.\nAs for the solo and trio queue problem, this is actually unique to Marathon in the extraction shooter space because of their insistence on having longer TTKs, which makes it much more difficult to 1v3, and some shells having innate abilities which are just straight up better both for solo play and PvP in general, at no additional cost. To be blunt, the problem is Void and its true invisibility. There was already enough invisibility abuse in Destiny PvP from void hunters and that wasn't even true invis, you could still see a moving outline well enough. Bungie noticed that solo lobbies were all just picking Void and ratting, but there isn't really anything stopping trios from also all picking Void and ratting, but with triple the potential firepower. It might also be the case that some of the PvE events on the other maps will have mechanics that require 3 runners and that's why they're mandating it, but in doing so they really are taking the risk of losing the solo playing audience and banking entirely too much on groups of friends or LFGs, not unlike what they did in Destiny's higher-difficulty content.\nEsteeBestee\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nWell said on all fronts. I want to trust that Bungie will make a fun game, but the alpha test is just missing some of the things it sounds like they're banking on. In its current state, I wouldn't even play for free. I like the combat (I do actually like the TTK), but that alone isn't enough, there needs to be something else. If there is on release, great! If not, a lot of players like me who want to like the game will probably just avoid it.\n1 vote\ncrissequeira\nMay 1\nLink\nTangential to this conversation: I don’t like the term “battle royale”. I don’t know where it came from but it evokes nothing in me related to video games, and makes me think of Casino Royale or royal families. “Last player standing”, although not as catchy, would be a better name for that gameplay mode. But that’s just my opinion.\nSimilarly, “extraction shooter” evokes in me the idea of extracting hostages. I’m not sure what else I would call it. “Looting survival” perhaps?\nBut then again, I don’t play shooters. Like, I just don’t. lol The last time I enjoyed playing any shooter was Counter Strike: Source, when I was a teenager. I’m not educated enough about shooters it seems.\n1 vote\nCannibalisticApple\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nFor the record, the genre name comes from the Japanese dystopian novel and film Battle Royale, about a third-year junior high class dumped on an island by the government and forced to fight to the death until one student remains. Even the shrinking map is part of it, so I guess the game genre took even more inspiration from the book besides the \"only one survivor\" bit.\n10 votes\nMacha\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nAlso the name of the film was itself inspired by the boxing/wrestling format of a battle royal:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royal\nThough the format died off in boxing in the early 20th century and in wrestling is mostly known by the wwe brand name of royal rumble these days.\n5 votes\npapasquat\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nGreat flick, and to expand, Battle Royale is the exact template for how basically every BR game works. I rewatched it recently and it's pretty amazing how closely the plot of the movie more or less fits the mold of how a typical BR game goes, all the way down to the desperate final showdown between competitors with a ridiculous amount of loot.\n4 votes\ncrissequeira\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nDang. Thank you! I had no idea.\n2 votes\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nThe Battle Royale genre gets its name from a Japanese movie from 2000 where the totalitatian government forces a group of junior high students to fight to the death. That's more or less the goal of that genre, so it fits well.\nExtraction shooter is named that way because you as a player have to extract to survive. There is already a genre of games called looter shooters, but the emphasis there is on frequent loot drops from enemies and rewards, not looting the map. Looting survival is somewhat redundant as looting and scavenging is generally considered an integral part of survival games.\nIt's interesting to see the perspective of someone that's not into shooters though. Extraction shooters themselves are already a small niche within shooters, so that makes them even more esoteric.\n6 votes\nfefellama\nMay 1\nLink\nWhat are your thoughts on a game like HOLE? Never played it but saw someone recommend it in a 'what games have you been playing' thread and added it to my list of games to check out one day. It appears to be an extraction shooter, but I'm not super familiar with the genre. However it's single-player only, which seems to be unique compared to the games you've mentioned which have some element of PvP in them. And obviously it's a small indie game compared to those other ones. Just figured I'd bring it up in case you or anyone else hast any thoughts about it or about single-player extraction shooters in general (if they exist) since I'm not huge on PvP these days.\n1 vote\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nI've never heard of this game before, but going of of the developer's helpful description of everything in the game (to be fair it's very simple so there's not much), I wouldn't consider this an extraction shooter at all. There's no loot or risk of losing anything, you just go in, shoot enemies, and find the exit. It's so barebones I'm not really sure what to call it other than just a singleplayer FPS.\nIf you wanted a singleplayer experience that's closer to an extraction shooter in terms of not just gameplay but also stakes, I think either roguelike shooters or survival shooters would come closer as those usually have the higher stakes of losing gear or progress on defeat.\n2 votes\nfefellama\nMay 1\nLink\nParent\nThanks for the analysis. Roguelike shooters are a good shout, plenty of good ones out there. I'm not really familiar with survival shooters, but I'll check em out!\nThrowdoBaggins\nMay 4\nLink\nReading your description (and briefly having a go at Cycle:Frontier for a bit before it got shut down) I know that Sea of Thieves is not an extraction shooter, but I’m having trouble pinning down where it fails to meet your description. My opinion is mostly down to knowing the vibes of extraction shooters and that Sea of Thieves doesn’t match it.\nThoughts on what Sea of Thieves is missing (or has) which excludes it from being an “extraction shooter”?\n1 vote\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 5\nLink\nParent\nSea of Thieves would be considered an open world PvEvP adventure game. I haven't played it myself, but from what I've seen of it, it doesn't appear to be a rounds-based game but rather a more persistent open-world lobby with no time limit. Extraction shooters are rounds-based with time limits to apply pressure on the player to act prudently rather than meander about or hide until everyone else is gone. If you're completely defeated in a round or run out of time, you don't get to respawn and try and get your stuff back as the next round will be a completely different one, so the stakes are high. Someone in some comment or post somewhere described it as \"gear fear\", and that is what I consider to be the core element of an extraction shooter.\nThrowdoBaggins\nMay 5\nLink\nParent\nExtraction shooters are rounds-based with time limits to apply pressure on the player to act prudently rather than meander about or hide until everyone else is gone.\nOh, I guess my understanding has been coloured by Cycle:Frontier because they weren’t rounds-based. They had a dangerous storm roll through the map on a regular basis (once per hour maybe? My memory of details is very hazy) but if you managed to hunker down in a building you’d be safe until the storm passed. And to counteract that, as long as the server was up you would have fresh people dropping in, so you’d never actually be the last player to safely scavenge.\nI guess they had four hour (I think?) server reboots too which capped how long a single player could stay in the map, but I’ve never had a Sea of Thieves session go that long (I know they technically can) so I never considered it a deliberate time limit.\nHaving wrote all this out, I also realised death in Sea of Thieves is very different — personal death doesn’t take away your weapons and supplies (if you die with a pocketful of cannonballs I believe you still respawn with them in your pockets) and your ship sinking is inconvenient but technically you could sail back and re-collect all your supplies if they’re still there.\nFlashfall\n(OP)\nMay 5\nLink\nParent\nHaven't played Cycle: Frontier either but I've read the thoughts of a number of former players on it recently (lots of comparison going on in the Marathon and ARC Raiders subreddits, unsurprisingly), and the lack of a time limit was one thing they mentioned that hurt the game's pacing, but it was otherwise a solid extraction shooter. The rounds-based thing with a time limit might not be a hard rule, but if players can afford to avoid each other and just play it like it's PvE many of them will, which considerably lowers the tension in what's meant to be a high-stakes genre.\nFal\nApril 30\nLink\nI'm putting this here after writing the rest of my post, but could we please get an \"expand edit window\" option, unless there is one and I'm blind?
