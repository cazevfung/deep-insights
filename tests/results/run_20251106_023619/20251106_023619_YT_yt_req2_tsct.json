  "content": "Hey guys. So we'll be talking today about cursor and indexing management. We're trying to see how it's going to be important to integrate them or remove them from cursor picking up things that we don't want to see. For example, the EMP file. A great use case is engineers within the enterprise see stuff they don't want to reveal to cursor API keys, super secret IP files that they don't want them touching. So we are going to try to figure out how to remove that using car cursor ignore as well as what prompts we can use to allow for indexing and ignoring non-essential files or files we want to keep separate. So let's jump over to cursor and see how we can do this. Here I have my currently indexed codebase and you see that 100% the indexing has been completed and I have 837 files across this folder called broadcom. That's just for our example. It's a dummy website with some, you know, just kind of recreating the launch page that cursor built out for us just for demo purposes. And you can see that everything's completed. But let's say that there's some issues with indexing and it's not detecting certain files or I changed file names. What I can do is sync it up. And if I feel like there are any changes and it sees that it wasn't picked up, that's where the syncing comes in handy. But let's say that we don't like the way it's indexing certain files. What we could do is actually delete the index and have a reindex so that it creates a better branching and embedding of where your files are located as well as directory. So here we do a quick delete index. It's not deleting anything important. It's just a way for it to quickly search and reference files or folders within your directory. By deleting that, you're not deleting any sensitive files. Your codebase will still be solided and have no issues. So once I deleted that indexing now all I can go back to is compute indexing and as you can see it goes through all the different folders you know Broadcom Angular JSON folds at building out and it's quickly kind of syncing up with what we had before and now kind of maybe some changes or something that was missing the first time. So how do you make that better? Now it's all synced in great. So this way it's kind of like a restart button any issues. great way to kind of rebuild and have cursor really understand your code base more. Now that we have the indexing covered, let's talk about how to do cursor ignore. As you can see here, I don't have any cursor ignore files on here. And there are two ways to quickly create a cursor ignore something that you don't want to reveal the cursor. And in our case, we're going to stick with the file here. We have a super secret API URL that we don't want them to see. So two methods that we can do is we can edit it from the cursor settings. So, kind of quickly over here, we go under cursor settings and cursor settings. And it should open up this screen has a couple menus that you can go through, but we're going to be focusing on indexing and docs to make sure the cursor ignore has what we need. Right below codebase indexing, we go under ignore files in cursor ignore and we can edit this adding anything that we don't want cursor to see. So, here we can add av file and click save. Now the EMV file is not being read and AI features are disabled for ENV. So to confirm that we can try to add our EMV file to the context. So the file is still there. When we try to click it, nothing happens. We can't add it. And then let's say read my EMV file just to see if it's able to pick it up. It sees that there's some sort of file, but it can't read it because it's not available and is being ignored. So there's no way for it to understand that there file so it won't read anything sensitive and keep your space protected. But let's say you want it more complex and let's remove the cursor ignore file. Let's say we want to ignore a couple files and we don't want to go under the settings and we want cursor to help us create that file. So we could go into the AI chat panel and say help me create a cursor ignore file. Let's say we want to hide B files as well as read. All right. So now I have the agent mode set up using claw 3.7. And when I run this, there should be a generation of a cursor ignore file that includes v as well as the readme.md. So as you see it creates the new file as well as that cursor ignore file. And you can see now suddenly readme is also being unttracked and AI features are disabled. So now I have cursor just create me a cursor ignore. So any complicated steps, it even says any variants of ENV is also being removed. It helps you create branches or more complicated cursor ignores for certain scenarios that you may come up with. And by using just English or natural language, it's now able to hide files or remove files that you don't want to see or don't want it indexed. So we can sync, make sure everything's up to code. Now let's try to add our VD file if you prefer. or read me. You see, I'm not able to click in to add it to context. And let me say read my read me and talking bot. So now it should say that this time I look for the files, but it's not allowed to search or index through them. So then now there nothing that I can do. It's nothing that it can create and it's trying to search, but it can't find anything because it's not allowed to search over them. So there's a simple demonstration on how you can use cursor and cursor ignore to hide any valuable or hidden things that you really want cursor not to know or index. And it's a great way to do that using the AI chat terminal or going through cursor settings under indexing and docs and doing it yourself. Great. Thank you and see you in the next video. Hey guys.
