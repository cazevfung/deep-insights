  "content": "How to Boost Cursor’s Understanding of Your Entire Codebase\nDaniel Avila\nFollow\n5 min read\n·\nJul 8, 2025\n32\n1\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nI’ve been using Cursor for months now, and while it’s great at understanding individual files, I always felt frustrated when working with larger codebases.\nCursor would give me solid suggestions for the code I was looking at, but it struggled to understand how everything connected across my project.\nThe Problem I Was Facing\nWorking on a React/Node.js project with about 200 files, I’d constantly run into situations where:\nI wanted to refactor a function but couldn’t easily see what would break\nI needed to understand data flow across multiple components\nI was looking for similar patterns that already existed in the codebase\nOnboarding new team members was painful because they couldn’t grasp the overall architecture\nCursor helped with individual files, but I was missing the bigger picture.\nThat’s when I decided to use Deep Graph MCP to enhance Cursor’s repository knowledge and give it the architectural context it was missing.\nWhat Deep Graph MCP Actually Does\nInstead of Cursor only seeing your current file, Deep Graph MCP gives it a map of your entire codebase as an interconnected graph. Now I can ask questions like:\n“What functions call this authentication method?”\n“Show me the complete data flow from this API endpoint”\n“Find similar error handling patterns in this codebase”\nAnd get accurate, contextual answers.\nHow I Set It Up\nThe setup took me about 5 minutes:\nStep 1: Open Cursor Settings\nCursor > Settings\nGo to “Tools & Integrations” → “MCP Tools”\nClick on “Add Custo MCP”\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nStep 2: Add This Configuration\nFor public repos like facebook/react (if you want test first):\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"Deep Graph MCP\": {\n\"command\": \"npx\",\n\"args\": [\n\"-y\",\n\"mcp-code-graph@latest\",\n\"facebook/react\"\n]\n}\n}\n}\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nFor my private project (needed a CodeGPT account):\n{\n\"mcpServers\": {\n\"Deep Graph MCP\": {\n\"command\": \"npx\",\n\"args\": [\n\"-y\",\n\"mcp-code-graph@latest\",\n\"YOUR_CODEGPT_API_KEY\",\n\"CODEGPT_API_KEY\", // Required\n\"CODEGPT_ORG_ID\", // Optional\n\"CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID\" // Optional\n]\n}\n}\n}\nCreate a CodeGPT account for free in this link:\nSign up for CodeGPT and empower your business with a team of AI co-pilots.\nExplore our AI Assistants and Copilot Generator Platform, tailored for businesses, personal use, and coding. We offer…\napp.codegpt.co\nGet your API KEY and ORG ID in the section “API Connections”:\nAnd Upload your repo in Code Graph to get your CODEGPT_GRAPH_ID\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nWith everything set up, you’ll be able to see the MCP and the tools already available.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nUse the MCP\nTo use the MCP you just have to open the cursor chat and it will automatically detect the tools and show you a message to execute them.\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nFull response directly from the React repository\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nReal Examples from My Workflow\nHere are actual scenarios where this made a difference:\nGet Daniel Avila’s stories in your inbox\nJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.\nSubscribe\nRefactoring a shared utility function: Before: Manually grep through files to find usages Now: “What files use the formatDate function and how?\" - instant comprehensive list\nUnderstanding authentication flow: Before: Opening 8 different files to trace the login process Now: “Walk me through the complete user authentication flow” — clear explanation with relevant code snippets\nFinding code patterns: Before: Hoping I’d remember where I implemented similar logic Now: “Show me other places where we handle async API calls with error boundaries” — found 3 similar patterns I’d forgotten about\nWhat Actually Changed\nThe biggest change isn’t the individual features — it’s that Cursor now feels like it actually understands my project. Instead of context-switching between files in my head, I can ask architectural questions and get intelligent answers.\nIt’s particularly useful when:\nPlanning refactors (understanding impact)\nCode reviews (seeing broader implications)\nFeature development (finding existing patterns)\nDebugging (tracing through call chains)\nSmall Issues I Hit\nCursor sometimes doesn’t recognize the MCP for searches. In this case, you have two options:\nForce MCP usage in your prompt: If your MCP is named “Deep Graph MCP”, add to your prompt: “Use Deep Graph MCP to perform the following task…”\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\nChange the MCP name to your repository name: In the JSON configuration, change “Deep Graph MCP” to your repository name. This way you can ask Cursor more naturally, like: “In Project A, create the Login component”\nWorth the Setup Time?\nAbsolutely. It took 5 minutes to set up and has already saved me hours of manually tracing through code. If you work with codebases larger than a few dozen files, this is a no-brainer.\nThe combination feels natural, Cursor’s AI capabilities with actual architectural understanding of your project.\nTry It Yourself\nPick a repository (start with a public one to test)\nAdd the MCP configuration to Cursor\nAsk it some architectural questions about your code\nSee how it changes your workflow\nI’m planning to set this up for our other projects too. It’s one of those tools that makes you wonder how you worked without it.\nGet the tool here: Deep Graph MCP\nYou can follow me on my social media:\nLinkedIn (Spanish): https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-avila-arias/\nTwitter (English): https://x.com/dani_avila7\nClap if you enjoyed this article 👏 👏 👏",
