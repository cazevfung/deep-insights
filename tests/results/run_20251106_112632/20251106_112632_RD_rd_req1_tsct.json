Your hope your cast of villains, heroes, and inbetweeners will be fawned over for ages once you finally get published, or that your favorite celebrity will end up playing the role of in the feature film that is destined to come from your work. Characters are pretty important. Whether you’re writing a literary fiction piece that is in the perspective of a fly on the wall, or you’re writing a rushing action novella that focuses on a rogue spy, your character matters. In all of your effort to make them as believable as possible, you might pick their brains a bit, pretend you’re in their situation, or formulate a full-fledged Oprah interview for them to get to know them better.\nThis is where things can get out of hand.\nA major pitfall to ‘getting to know your characters’ is falling into the trap of autonomous characterization. That sounds really fancy and snazzy and all, but it’s about as pertinent to your writing process as your mother-in-law buying you a meat tenderizer after you’ve told her about seventeen times that you’re a vegan and couldn’t possibly have any use for it. In other words,\nYou might say, \"But Teva, I need to know my characters as much as possible!\", and while I entirely understand that, treating them as entities apart from yourself is not actually going to help you know them \"as much as possible\". To that you might say, \"But Teva! HOW ELSE CAN I KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THEM?!\"\nLet's look at this logic, shall we.\nIf you walk up to a random stranger, anywhere you see fit to walk up to random strangers, and begin asking them a series of personal questions, assuming that they actually answer you, do you suddenly know more about them than they know about themselves?\nWhat you have learned is something from an outsider’s perspective. You just learned something that anyone else could learn by asking the same person the same questions, assuming they felt like answering honestly, and something that the person being asked still knows more about than you do. If you asked me what my favorite color was, I might say purple. I probably wouldn't explain that I actually only say that because it's one of the few colors I think suits me, even though I really don't have a particularly\nYour autonomous character controls the information, if you let them. By this logic, your character has their own personality, their own brain, their own decision making skills- Which leaves you at their mercy as far as progress and continuation goes.\nCan you see where this is going?\nWhat sense does it make, as a writer, to rely on something\nfor something as crucial as a plot point, character development, or even a solid slope of progress in your actual story? What sense would it make to rely on something\nto tell you how the story should go, how you should be treating them, what should be happening, when it should be happening- What sense would that make?\nI'll tell you what. It makes no sense.\nThe trouble with autonomous characters is fairly simple: You are giving your control as a creator over to something that you created, as opposed to taking that control and using it to flesh out this creation as best you can as a creator. Once you have convinced yourself that, \"Hey, my characters have minds of their own. They can think for themselves.\nThey are their own person.\nThey can do what they want!\" you are basically signing yourself up for a backseat-driver that can be as difficult as they damn well please. Once you have that, you have a dozen excuses for why you aren't writing, and a bigger problem than the plot hole you started off with.\nYou have a giant, leeching beetle on your shoulder there.\nThis character, once you've let it decide that it is indeed as real as you are, is bound to create an uphill battle for your progress. They might decide to just stop talking to you, right when you were thinking your draft was just about done, leaving you high and dry for progress or motivation; or worse, they will change their minds about everything you decided beforehand, and decide that they will not love Billy no matter how much you need them to love Billy, and instead they will love Amar, because face it Amar is way hotter than Billy could ever dream of being.\nThis sort of thing leaves you floating from \"between a rock and a hard place\" and \"so frustrated I could tear my hair out\".\nThe problem isn't your character!\nThe problem is that you, the author, decided to give your control over to something you created, under the false pretenses of \"getting to know them better\" for writing purposes. We all know why you did it. You wanted this to be easier, less of a hassle, more\n. The trouble with that is... well, you already know the trouble with that. That's why you're in this predicament. You've just realized how much trouble your autonomous character actually is. So what are you going to do about it?\nI'll tell you what you should do about it.\nRip up the idea that an autonomous character is going to make your life easier. Print it out, invite some friends over, light that idea on fire with a heavy dosing of lighter fluid and watch it\n. After that, I would personally roast some s'mores over the kindling ashes. Your characters should be\nto you, as the author. They should be under your control. You, as the author and creator of these characters, should be able to construct them in such a way that it would be really easy to think they were real. You should know everything about them, every quirk, every mannerism, and every bad habit down to the fact that they sometimes pretend that their action figure collection holds value outside of their sentimental connection to it. \"But how on earth do I figure all of that out without talking to them, Teva?\"\nYou'll probably need to plan and plot quit a lot, but you still have to write. The best way to see how a character responds to a situation is to put them in it. Would that character\ngive up being with Billy for the sake of Amar’s hotness, or did you write them in a way that Billy’s sensibility would win out in their final decision? If you really must know absolutely everything about your character, write some non-story scenes that test your character’s personality, and use it as a reference for things that happen in your works. Put yourself in that character's place by practicing their dialogue. Write a journal from their perspective, if you wish. At the end of the day, you just have to remember two things:\nYour characters aren't real, and you are in control.\nwindow.POST_ID = 't3_17l9nk';\nconst e=\"image\",t=\"video\",i=\"embed\",n=\"devvit\",d=\"no_media\",o=\"unknown\",r=[\"SHREDDIT-PLAYER-2\",\"SHREDDIT-PLAYER-STATIC-HLSJS\"];function a(e){return performance.mark(\"post-consumption-ready\",{detail:{mediaType:e}})}function s(){if(!window.POST_ID)return void console.error(\"[post-load-performance-mark] POST_ID not found\");const s=document.querySelector(`shreddit-post[id=${window.POST_ID}] div[slot=\"post-media-container\"], shreddit-post[id=${window.POST_ID}] shreddit-post-text-body`)?.querySelector(\"shreddit-player-2, shreddit-player-static-hlsjs, img, video, shreddit-embed, shreddit-tweet-embed, shreddit-devvit-ui-loader\");s&&function(e,t={}){const{checkInViewport:i=!0,requireVisible:n=!1}=t,d=e.getBoundingClientRect(),o=window.innerHeight||document.documentElement.clientHeight,r=window.innerWidth||document.documentElement.clientWidth;let a=!0;if(i){const e=d.bottom>0&&d.right>0&&d.top<o&&d.left<r;a=a&&e}if(n){const t=window.getComputedStyle(e),i=d.width>0&&d.height>0&&\"none\"!==t.display&&\"hidden\"!==t.visibility&&\"0\"!==t.opacity;a=a&&i}return a}(s)?async function(d){if(!d)return;const s=d.tagName;let c=o,m=d;if(s.endsWith(\"-EMBED\")&&(c=i,await customElements.whenDefined(d.tagName.toLowerCase()),await d.updateComplete,m=d.shadowRoot.querySelector(\"iframe\")),\"SHREDDIT-DEVVIT-UI-LOADER\"===s)return c=n,void d.addEventListener(\"devvit-app-first-render\",(()=>a(c)),{once:!0});if(r.includes(s))return c=t,d.autoplay?void d.videoElement.addEventListener(\"playing\",(()=>a(c)),{once:!0}):(await customElements.whenDefined(d.tagName.toLowerCase()),await d.updateComplete,void a(c));if(m&&\"VIDEO\"===m.tagName)return c=t,void m.addEventListener(\"loadeddata\",(()=>a(c)));m&&\"IMG\"===m.tagName&&(c=e,m.complete)?a(c):m&&m.addEventListener(\"load\",(()=>{a(c)}))}(s):a(d)}\"undefined\"==typeof window||window.process?.env?.WTR_TEST||window.SKIP_POST_LOAD_PERF_MARK_AUTO_RUN||s();export{s as init};\nMy characters are real, and they are in control.

If someone is having enough trouble keeping control of their characters that they're unable to enact any sort of control over them whatsoever, they've got a much bigger problem on their hands.

Without that sort off depth, you risk shallow, programmed characterization that, as it's stemmed from a desire to move the plot along, feels like it's been designed to do just that. If a character becomes too uncontrollable in their design process, then some discipline is needed. In a story, you're arguably playing God, so why would they get the final say, even as people? It may sound harsh, but us writers aren't benevolent deities.\nAnd, if they manage to surprise us, by working around our (Often cruel) plans, then that may very well make the narrative more exciting. If it can surprise the writer, then shouldn't it have an even better chance at surprising the audience?\nBut yes, discipline. Discipline is important.\nIf you asked me what my favorite color was, I might say purple. I probably wouldn't explain that I actually only say that because it's one of the few colors I think suits me, even though I really don't have a particularly favorite color.\nIt's kind of funny that in talking about how character interviews aren't useful, you provide an example of how they can be useful. If you're not going to put any effort into thinking why purple is someone's favorite color, there's no point. Your detailed answer provides us with some information: this person would rather just go with the flow instead of saying, \"I don't really have a favorite color,\" because answers like that just elicit more questions. They have some opinion about their clothes (rather than just being indifferent to them). If you wanted to pick a main sense for this character, sight would probably be a bad choice, given the fact that they don't really react strongly to color. Touch, smell, hearing, would be better options.\nAnd the closest I've ever come to having writers block was when I sat down to actually plot something scene-by-scene. As a pantser who writes character driven narratives, I'm used to dealing with the sensation of my characters going \"off script\" and for me, it's really just a challenge. And while it can be frustrating, it's a good kind of frustrating, a puzzle that when solved is very satisfying.\nI never said that the interviews weren’t useful. I said that that begins the process of creating a divide between you, the author, and the character you have created.\nI don’t know how many other ways I can say it’s a bad idea, so I won’t try.
