    "Does it speak to how jaded I am that when the quote, \"We're not going to make the same mistakes again.\" I immediately thought, \"No, you're...uh...you're making all new ones.\"",
    "Concord wasn’t a fluke. It was made with everything you wouldn’t want in a game you already enjoy. These companies saying it was a fluke or wasn’t successful because of failure to inspire are on copium.",
    "It's wild that in 2025 we gamers can take one look at a game and know that it will be delayed despite the developers of said game having no clue that will happen. How out of touch must a dev studio be for this to be the situation?",
    "It's not a game for Marathon fans. It's not a game for Extraction Shooter fans. It's just smoke and mirrors to appease investors so the leadership can pay themselves huge salaries and bonuses.",
    "I think you missed a very crucial talking point that Sony never considered: live service titles are gluttons for time and thus a typical consumer will rarely pursue more than one, and most people who are willing to play them already do, so it’s not really a market with potential customers. When all you have is supply but no demand you’re in the prime position to fail as a merchant. And Sony wanted to make a bunch without considering that the infinite money exploit that’s too good to be true… was exactly that",
    "I HIGHLY doubt they had no idea. The writing was on the wall. All of them.",
    "soulless use of an IP that was ignored for 2+ decades. Hopefully this just doesn't come out",
    "They should turn it into a single player game while they're at it.",
    "Sony’s big mistake was in 2022 when the spunked 3.7 billion down the drain in acquiring Bungee.",
    "Indefinite delay is just PR talk for cancelled. And why it wouldn't be? This game was named after an already existing franchise, but didn't share any substantial gamepplay elements and not many people even know about. Didn't had any anticipation for it as the beta they did only managed 1k players, no big streamer covered it so they forced employees to larp as ones. Finally they stole the entire art direction of the game and got caught. Meaning that they can't even show the game to avoid further litigation until they redo all the art assets from scratch. While the game has been a colosal waste of time and money it's better to call it quits rather than keep wasting more of both on a product that to anyone with half a frontal lobe, was DOA.",
    "Please let this be sony puting there foot down. Bungie managment has been sabotaging the studio for years",
    "Bungie has always had an amazing developer base and a shitty/underhanded leadership. If Sony really wants to save Bungie, Marathon, and Destiny - they should immediately fire all the leadership and executive positions at Bungie and replace them with people that are focused on more than just bleeding the studio of the most money possible before bouncing.",
    "oh man that chart that follows up Destiny and Helldivers with Marathon and Fairgames hit me like a freight train",
    "Shoulda just made it another immersive sim fps, like it's predecessors, except development would have had to have started over 4 years ago",
    "0:12 “staff has no idea” with all the key art being stolen… smh",
    "It seriously feels like Sony is headed for a double whammy train wreck if they're counting on Marathon and Fairgame$ being smash hits.",
    "As an old Bungie fan, lover of Marathon and Halo and having read all the lore and done all the deep dives and been obsessed with the lore and history of the series and company... good. Bungie is dead.",
    "I'm laughing at all the clowns who praised the CGI cinematic short. I was calling since day 1, it's going to have NONE of those story elements or character interactions, it's all a trick to make you think it's deeper than it is but in reality it's a shallow ankle deep puddle you've seen multiple times before",
    "A game in a played-out genre with bog-standard gameplay wearing the skin of a franchise verging on thirty years since its last release. Marathon needs to be \"delayed\" into the nearest dumpster and Sony needs to toss Bungie's entire executive suite into it right after.",
    "The yearly, \"We'll do better next time.\" That every publisher is required to make.",
    "Bungie deserves its fall. It’s a shell of its former glory and hallow company being wore as a skin suit.",
    "It's very amusing to me that Youtube listed Concord under the video description. They know.",
    "It's very rare for me to be able to say this, especially as a huge FPS fan, but there is not a single aspect of Marathon that appeals to me.",
    "Bungie never understood that their cult like following can only take them so far, there’s so much you can do until people start realizing how bad things are. I started playing Destiny during the pandemic and became one of the cultists, until ironically someone asked for a bug to be corrected on twitter and everyone else went against that person, saying they were not entitled to make demands for a game that wasn’t theirs. In my eyes, nothing makes you more entitled to ask for corrections than having paid for what you’re complaining about.",
    "\"some of the feedback has been varied\" is the most dishonest corporate spin I've seen",
    "Marathon lost more than half it's playerbase in a day, and that was within the coveted access pool. Game is cooked.",
    "They were so used to undercooked destiny games coming out that they thought they could do it a 3rd time. Thats why they were shocked. Most of the people working at bungie know nothing other than releasing unfinished titles and then fixing and finishing them over the next few years.",
    "CEOs will never understand that you can't have multiple live service games in parallel, will they ? they compete with each other, if you make a new successful live service game, it will take players from your previous live service game. it's wild that for those companies having a successful product is not enough, they need all of it, they need the entire market, they need to compete for control in the entire industry.",
    "As glad as I am they sledged Marathon as it became too much of a risk, I unfortunately know there will be no positive outcomes. Execs already have their golden parachutes; staff is gonna get laid off even more to be shown as an example; even more of Bungie is going to die to this.",
    "Someone at Sony finally came to the realization that Marathon in its current state would probably launch worse than Concord did."
