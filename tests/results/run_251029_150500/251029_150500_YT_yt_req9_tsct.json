  "content": "Listen, Dad. I I I know you work hard, okay? I get it. You're out there working really hard during the week so that you can come home and just relax a little bit, not have to worry about a whole lot. You play with your kids, maybe if you've got them, or if you don't, you you sort of generally understand, right? You you go out, you work hard, you want something to do just to relax, to to just sit back and maybe maybe feel a little bit like a kid again. Trust me, man. I I know the feeling. I am right there with you. which is why I decided to create a list of five extraction shooters for dads. Different kind of dads actually. You see, for me personally, I love extraction shooters and there is a lot out there when it comes to extraction shooters. However, if you're looking for specific things, if you're looking for the that realistic experience, but not being too hardcore to where you have to put in like a,000 hours of gameplay. If that's what you're looking for, that's what you're going to find here. And I've sort of got it organized for whatever experience you're looking for. My name is Tacti and I'm on a quest to find the most immersive experiences available on the internet. And today we've got five extraction shooters for dads. The first game that we've got here is for the single dad. And I don't mean I I don't mean that you're a single dad, though you might be. What I mean is that you really don't want to you don't want to have to go against other people, right? You want to play alone. Maybe you you want to play co-op every now and then, but primarily you just you just want a casual experience that that you don't have to worry too much about other people. You just want to you want to shoot bots. No, I get it. Completely get it. But at the same time, you want that extraction experience. You want that progression. You want cool guns, animations. Incursion Red River has got you covered. You see, this is an early access game. It's actually fairly inexpensive. For only $17, you can get a Tarov single player or co-op experience where you're just going in shooting bots. It's that start in your hideout, build your load out, build up your resources, go into a raid, grab what you need or do what you need done, shoot some bots, grab their loot, and then come back and progress. You've got different traders that you can level up. It's single player Tarov. Okay, if you've heard of Tarov, you probably are watching this video. As of right now, it's fairly bare bones. It is an early access experience, but the but the bones are there. And if you're just looking for a chill singleplayer experience, this game I think this game was probably going to scratch that itch. First and foremost, they've got a beautiful, beautiful environment. The game is set in like a Vietnam kind of environment. At the making of this video, they've got two maps that are fairly well expanded, but the the graphics look fantastic. The animations are gorgeous. The weapon sounds are great. The AI can be look look the AI man. AI doesn't get great no matter where you go pretty much. But it's still a fun experience in my opinion and it's lighthearted. If you want to go in for like couple of raids, you can do that. If you want to go in for just just to shoot people, you can do that as well. It's certainly certainly not on the level of Tarov. It is not that indepth. You go to the computer, you get your stuff, you figure out what you have to do, you figure out your quest, and then you go into the quest and and you get it done, and then you extract. It's it's just like that. It's nothing in-depth. There's not a huge story to it, but overall, for $17, I mean, it'll get you a few hours of fun for sure, and it'll give you something to progress in your free time as you're just playing by yourself. For me personally, it's not something that I want to sit down and play for too long. I'll play every update to see sort of what's going on and what's new with the game, but it is an alternative for you. For you single dads out there, it might be uh might be up your alley. Up next, we've got the chill dad. So, anytime I play this game, it makes me feel kind of relaxed. I want to put on just casual low-fi music. I want to light a candle behind me. I want to smell some fire going on. It It's probably a good game for fall. Another one on this list is as well, but the game is Arena Breakout Infinite. Now, what's nice about this game is it's completely free. You don't have to spend any money to have any fun in this game. You can you can just download it and play it for free from their launcher. Unfortunately, it's not on Steam. Uh I think they're expected to come out on consoles at some point, but I don't know for sure. I feel like that was announced a long time ago, but they haven't said a lick about it. But the game itself is essentially a Tarov light with a lot of quality of life features that make it easier to play the game and progress in the game. You've got a lot of the same features. You've got weapon customization. You've got different quests with different traders. You've got some different ammos that you're going to have to worry about and sort of figure out what works best. So, so it does go in depth there, but what's nice is that when you get into the map, you're going to be able to see things like the compass. You're going to be able to open the map to see where you are. You're going to be able to see where your quest lies. Just a lot of good quality of life things that takes that Tarov experience and makes it more casual so the dads, the chill dads like yourself and I can uh can have a good time. Now, it is PvE and PvP, so you may get into some intense firefights. You may lose some gear, but for me, I'm like an average gamer, okay? I'm not I'm not great. I'm not terrible in most games. And I do a really good job at just kind of keeping my money steady, right around 2 mil, sometimes around 3 mil. The game, if you want, and I I don't recommend this, you could pay like 50 bucks to get $5 million in game. That's the one silly thing about it. It is pay to win in that sense, but technically you can lose it. So, you know, make that decision by yourself. I still enjoy playing it and haven't really come up with uh come up against a ton of different chats, which is good because they've got a few different modes as well. You can go more casualized mode or you can go a lockown mode or forbidden mode. These modes are going to have different tiers of gear. So, if you want to avoid a bunch of Chads completely, just just stay in the starter mode. Out of all the games on this list, it's probably the one that I've played most within the past year or so. I have really enjoyed it. I haven't played it for a while, but I do know that they have seasons, they have battle passes, you can spend some money on those. So, you know, you can support the game that way. It does give you some progression. In my opinion, it's a lot of fun. I I do have a lot of fun even as a solo, but if you got buddies, you can play it as well. The graphics, they look great. The animations look great. I I just there's not a lot bad I can say about this game other than the pay to- win aspect. So, what's cool is if you hop in, you really don't have to pay any money to see if you like it and want to support the game there. So, it really is just a time thing for you. Next up, we've got the Tactical Dad. And this game is Grey Zone Warfare. You've probably heard of it. You've probably seen it. This is an openw world uh Vietnam style of extraction shooter. I'm going to say extraction shooter, but they're sort of moving away from that. So, as of the making of this video, it is still sort of an extraction shooter. You've got the same mechanics. You can extract with a helicopter. However, the way that they've just changed the game, you you don't always have to extract and go to base. You can go to those little outposts or or just call some things in if you finish a quest. It's I don't know. It's not really much of an extraction shooter. More of an openw world MMO PVEP kind of game. For me, unfortunately, this is the hardest one to run. I've hardly played this latest update because I anytime I play it crashes on me. So, I haven't really gotten to experience it, unfortunately. I love the game. I love the dev team and I love the game's ideas, the game's mechanics, but I just I haven't been able to play. Razone Warfare is one of those games that it's got a really beautiful environment, but it can get kind of um repetitive uh because you you only have that one giant map that's in like the the Vietnamese experience in in Lang. That's what it's called in Lang. So, there's not a lot of diversity when it comes to like your environment. The quests are going to be those typical like kill these people here, grab this here, move this here, place this here. It it has a story to it, and I think they're going to flush out the story a little bit more as the game progresses. But again, this is early access, so the game kind of es and flows. Again, you've got those traders that you can progress. You've got weapons that you can put together. Not a ton of weapons. Not a ton of weapons, unfortunately. You've got like ARs, you've got the MCX, you've got your AK, several different ones. So, just not a ton of diversity when it comes to that as well. But all in all, this is a game that provides a pretty good hardcore tactical experience. And if you do find people in the game, if if you end up finding somebody with your specific faction, uh you'll be able to team up with them and complete things and and you know, kind of get tactical with them. The game itself has several different tiers, several different uh buyins for the game. And with each buyin, kind of like Tarov, you get a new experience. You get new stuff. You get like different additions. You can support the game however you feel necessary or however however much you like the game. But if you want to only play the game with very minimal starting gear, you can buy the game for $40. That goes on sale. It's on Steam. To me, it's a pretty good deal. And the game tends to even after updates drop and stick around 2,000 players. So, you will still be able to find people online, though the PVE is going to be more prevalent than the PVP. So, be aware of that when you play. If you're looking for just that, those intense PvP moments, it's probably going to be more rare here. Uh, unless it's directly after an update, then you may not have as much of a problem. If you buy in, the game does let you choose different factions, and you can squat up with people only in your faction. You can choose one of three factions. So, if if you have buddies that want to play with you, make sure you're choosing the same faction. And otherwise, you're going to be going against each other. Now, we've got the the old school dad. And I say this because this is like for those those guys that want to be cowboys, okay? I I I know you you're you're over there watching Rifleman. You're sitting down and you're turning on John Wayne and just loving the heck out of it. Well, this is this is probably for you. For me personally, it's one another one of those fall games. It's just a it's a chill kind of casual experience, but it it can actually be very difficult. Hunt Showdown is the game and it's been around for a few years. It's it's done a really good job. Recently they they rebranded to what is it? Hunt 1768 or something. Way off 1896. They've rebranded to Hunt Showdown 1896. So So they've done a kind of a revamp. They've added a huge map. They've changed up the locations a little bit. But this game is like a horror PVEP. And what's nice about this, this is what I wish more extraction shooters would do because the others that that I've talked about in this list and the next one that I'm going to talk about is more that that missionbased uh looter shooter, that missionbased extraction shooter. So, you go in, you have a specific mission in a specific location. You go over there to to finish that and then you extract. Hunt's going to be a little bit different. Hunt, everybody has the same objective. So, this is more of an objective based. It's more of an objectivebased extraction shooter. We got it. We got it. Anyway, this game has a ton of those cowboy styled rifles because the game is set in 1896. You're going to get some repeaters. You're going to get bolt action. You're going to get shotguns. You're going to get crossbows. You're going to be able to throw some spears. That's hecking cool. That's a lot of fun. But there's an underlying story to it as well. An evil has gone across a land. You are a hunter, like a bounty hunter, and your goal is to kill the monster, grab the bounty, and extract. Other people, that is also their goal. So, you've got to fight for that bounty and extract safely. Sometimes there's one bounty on the map, sometimes there's two. Either way, people are drawn to those locations, and they've got to try to compete for those bounties. There are some other supernatural things that happen, like when you grab the bounty, you can kind of see where other people generally are. But my favorite thing about this game is just the environment. the way that it makes you feel. And by that I mean it's it's it's muddy, it's messy, it's grimy. I it it does not it is not a clean feeling game. Like when I see them shoot up some uh healing potions with with their syringe, it makes me think that that is so dirty and disgusting and but it it does a good job. I mean I I really really like Hunt Showdown and I I wish that I could play it a little bit more. The game itself feels really good. It is very hardcore, too, because it only takes a few bullets to kill people. There are different healing healing mechanics. You've got different effects when it comes to fire as well. And there is a general story line. Each new season brings some new kind of story. Sometimes they'll throw new bosses in. For me, it's a very intriguing game. I I do really love it's a highly immersive game. Really love it. It's also on consoles. So, you've got consoles, you've got PC, you've got consoles. Again, the game itself is about $30 if you want to just buy the base game. And in my opinion, it's generally worth it. Rays can take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes depending on how long you want to stay in there and if you even want to go for the bounty. Maybe you're just kind of getting kills and want to escape. That's up to you because you're the boss, Dad. You're the boss. And last but not least, we've got the Chad Dad. And I say this because it's sort of where everything begins. It's sort of the baseline for these other shooters kind of except for except for Hunt. Tarov. Tarov does have a PvE experience that you can play which is very very nice. And there are a few different ways that you can play it. First and foremost, unfortunately, you've got to purchase the base game. So, you can't just purchase a PVE experience. Instead, you have to purchase the base game and then purchase the PVE experience as an expansion onto that. So, the lowest you can get that for is $70. with that, you're going to be able to to get that PVP game, that PV PVP experience, and the same experience except in a PVE environment, including the operators. So, the operators that you'll find are also going to be uh just bots. But with that PVE upgrade, you're going to be able to play the game without worrying about any wipes. You can just progress it. You can keep going. I'm sure they're going to add some more quests, some more battle passes, or something like that in the future. The game is still technically in beta. has been for like 10 years now. So, uh it's nice that they have this though. It's nice that they added this. Otherwise, you'd have to play like single player Tarov, SP Tarov, Emu Tarov, one of those. And they would they don't like that very much. That that's against the terms of service and and if you especially if you make a video about it on YouTube, you can get dinged. Be careful. Eventually, last I recall, they're hoping to add mods to this and maybe some like generally hosted servers. Some co-op. You can do co-op, right? Yeah, you can do co-op, but generally if you're looking for the most immersive experience, that one's going to be it. I mean, it is by far the best extraction experience, most immersive, most indepth experience that you're going to get out of any of these. But with that PVE experience available now, if you're a dad, if you don't have a,000 hours to put into the game every week, I mean, nobody does technically, but if you don't have all that time to put into the game, all that effort, all that understanding to to learn, uh, you can experience this and it's going to be just a tad easier. You're not going to have to worry so much about other players. And there's going to be geared Chads in there that that are just bots that you're just going to and uh you'll feel good about yourself and grab their gear hopefully. Anyway, even if you do grab this just for the PvE experience, I would recommend hopping in for PvP because that that can be a lot of fun. Tarov is just it's got a vibe that no other game can touch. It's got an experience that no other game is going to be able to offer at this time because everything else just feels feels like a knockoff of Tarov. Not that they are not that they are. They're they're all they've all got different audiences, but but tarov the environments. You've got numerous amount of maps that you can progress through. You've got a bajillion quests. You've got a bajillion guns. You've got bajillion ways to modify your weapon. And you know, you just it's fun. I can't I can't deny it. As much as I think that they've done some silly things, I can't deny it. It's the best thing on the market. And that's why if you play it, you are the Chad debt because you are starting or going to experience where it all begins, where where the the core gameplay loop of the extraction shooter genre really got refined and released. Cuz technically you could argue like The Division was the first extraction shooter, which was great, but it it doesn't provide a hardcore experience like this. You could buy the entire game PvE, PvP. You'd get uh arena, which is their arena shooter, which is always kind of a strange concept to me. You'll get a bunch of season passages, a bunch of stuff. You can purchase the unheard edition at $250. If you're doing that, you're probably you're probably not watching this video to this point anyway. You've probably already spent your $17 that you had free on incursion Red River, which to each their own, man. I mean, if you if you got money to throw around and you want to do that, I that's fine with me. I just personally I would never spend $250 on any game. No shame. I've just got other things that I gota gotta keep up with. Groceries, man. Geez, what a what an expense in 2025. Anyway, some things that you should know if you've gotten through that list. If you're still here, I I want you to know that these games are going to be pretty hardcore. They're going to have lower time to kill. They're going to be fairly realistic because that's what I'm into. That's the kind of stuff that I enjoy. That's the kind of games that I want to dive into for the most part. I am like a a modern hardcore firsterson shooter kind of guy. That's my vibe. So So if you think anything on this list is dumb, that's fine. You're just you're probably just not we're just not vibing. Okay, we just we're not going to work out. I mean, at least not with this list, okay? Not yet. Just give me a chance, though. Hit that subscribe button. But I do feel like the extraction genre really just gives you the best experience that that you can have gaming. I mean, it's like a it's like a battle royaleish style of experience, but you know, more more compact. It's it's chopped up a little bit more cuz I love battle roy because of the intensity they bring. A lot of people do. And these extraction shooters offer kind of a slice to that. Uh, and some somewhat slower as well. You don't have to worry so much about getting to a specific location to to beat everybody, right? It's more of I'm going to go at my own pace. I'm going to slow things down. If you get caught running across an open field, that's sort of your own fault. You learn and you go slower next time. So, generally, I mean, you can you can play these games for a few hours a night. Uh or you could play it for a few hours a week. You can go at your own pace with these games. And that's sort of the where I wanted to to to land. That's sort of what I wanted to help you with because as a dad or as a working uh guy that just doesn't have a ton of time to game anymore. I wanted to give you something that was going to help you and give you something that's just kind of relaxing. Most of these unfortunately are just on a PC. So if you don't have a PC, I mean I guess you've got Hunt Showdown and maybe someday Arena Breakout Infinite, but other than that there's not Try Vigor, I guess. I don't know. There's some Armory Forger mods as well. Well, I should probably I should probably do a video on that. Either way, thank you so much for watching. I'm going to conclude this video. I appreciate the time that you've spent with me today. If you're still here, hit that like button if you liked it. Hit that dislike button if you didn't like it. Subscribe for more. And until the next one, keep working hard, Dad. Listen, Dad. I I I know you work hard, okay? I get it. You're out there working really hard during the week so that you can come home and just relax a little bit, not have to worry about a whole lot. You play with your kids, maybe if you've got them, or if you don't, you you sort of generally understand, right? You you go out, you work hard, you want something to do just to relax, to to just sit back and maybe maybe feel a little bit like a kid again. Trust me, man. I I know the feeling. I am right there with you. which is why I decided to create a list of five extraction shooters for dads. Different kind of dads actually. You see, for me personally, I love extraction shooters and there is a lot out there when it comes to extraction shooters. However, if you're looking for specific things, if you're looking for the that realistic experience, but not being too hardcore to where you have to put in like a,000 hours of gameplay. If that's what you're looking for, that's what you're going to find here. And I've sort of got it organized for whatever experience you're looking for. My name is Tacti and I'm on a quest to find the most immersive experiences available on the internet. And today we've got five extraction shooters for dads.

You've got like ARs, you've got the MCX, you've got your AK, several different ones. So, just not a ton of diversity when it comes to that as well. But all in all, this is a game that provides a pretty good hardcore tactical experience. And if you do find people in the game, if if you end up finding somebody with your specific faction, uh you'll be able to team up with them and complete things and and you know, kind of get tactical with them. The game itself has several different tiers, several different uh buyins for the game. And with each buyin, kind of like Tarov, you get a new experience. You get new stuff. You get like different additions. You can support the game however you feel necessary or however however much you like the game. But if you want to only play the game with very minimal starting gear, you can buy the game for $40. That goes on sale. It's on Steam. To me, it's a pretty good deal. And the game tends to even after updates drop and stick around 2,000 players. So, you will still be able to find people online, though the PVE is going to be more prevalent than the PVP. So, be aware of that when you play. If you're looking for just that, those intense PvP moments, it's probably going to be more rare here. Uh, unless it's directly after an update, then you may not have as much of a problem. If you buy in, the game does let you choose different factions, and you can squat up with people only in your faction. You can choose one of three factions. So, if if you have buddies that want to play with you, make sure you're choosing the same faction. And otherwise, you're going to be going against each other. Now, we've got the the old school dad. And I say this because this is like for those those guys that want to be cowboys, okay? I I I know you you're you're over there watching Rifleman. You're sitting down and you're turning on John Wayne and just loving the heck out of it. Well, this is this is probably for you. For me personally, it's one another one of those fall games. It's just a it's a chill kind of casual experience, but it it can actually be very difficult. Hunt Showdown is the game and it's been around for a few years. It's it's done a really good job. Recently they they rebranded to what is it? Hunt 1768 or something. Way off 1896. They've rebranded to Hunt Showdown 1896. So So they've done a kind of a revamp. They've added a huge map. They've changed up the locations a little bit. But this game is like a horror PVEP. And what's nice about this, this is what I wish more extraction shooters would do because the others that that I've talked about in this list and the next one that I'm going to talk about is more that that missionbased uh looter shooter, that missionbased extraction shooter. So, you go in, you have a specific mission in a specific location. You go over there to to finish that and then you extract. Hunt's going to be a little bit different. Hunt, everybody has the same objective. So, this is more of an objective based. It's more of an objectivebased extraction shooter. We got it. We got it. Anyway, this game has a ton of those cowboy styled rifles because the game is set in 1896. You're going to get some repeaters. You're going to get bolt action. You're going to get shotguns. You're going to get crossbows. You're going to be able to throw some spears. That's hecking cool. That's a lot of fun. But there's an underlying story to it as well. An evil has gone across a land. You are a hunter, like a bounty hunter, and your goal is to kill the monster, grab the bounty, and extract. Other people, that is also their goal. So, you've got to fight for that bounty and extract safely. Sometimes there's one bounty on the map, sometimes there's two. Either way, people are drawn to those locations, and they've got to try to compete for those bounties. There are some other supernatural things that happen, like when you grab the bounty, you can kind of see where other people generally are. But my favorite thing about this game is just the environment. the way that it makes you feel. And by that I mean it's it's it's muddy, it's messy, it's grimy. I it it does not it is not a clean feeling game. Like when I see them shoot up some uh healing potions with with their syringe, it makes me think that that is so dirty and disgusting and but it it does a good job. I mean I I really really like Hunt Showdown and I I wish that I could play it a little bit more. The game itself feels really good. It is very hardcore, too, because it only takes a few bullets to kill people. There are different healing healing mechanics. You've got different effects when it comes to fire as well. And there is a general story line. Each new season brings some new kind of story. Sometimes they'll throw new bosses in. For me, it's a very intriguing game. I I do really love it's a highly immersive game. Really love it. It's also on consoles. So, you've got consoles, you've got PC, you've got consoles. Again, the game itself is about $30 if you want to just buy the base game. And in my opinion, it's generally worth it. Rays can take anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes depending on how long you want to stay in there and if you even want to go for the bounty. Maybe you're just kind of getting kills and want to escape. That's up to you because you're the boss, Dad. You're the boss. And last but not least, we've got the Chad Dad. And I say this because it's sort of where everything begins. It's sort of the baseline for these other shooters kind of except for except for Hunt. Tarov. Tarov does have a PvE experience that you can play which is very very nice. And there are a few different ways that you can play it. First and foremost, unfortunately, you've got to purchase the base game. So, you can't just purchase a PVE experience. Instead, you have to purchase the base game and then purchase the PVE experience as an expansion onto that. So, the lowest you can get that for is $70. with that, you're going to be able to to get that PVP game, that PV PVP experience, and the same experience except in a PVE environment, including the operators. So, the operators that you'll find are also going to be uh just bots. But with that PVE upgrade, you're going to be able to play the game without worrying about any wipes. You can just progress it. You can keep going. I'm sure they're going to add some more quests, some more battle passes, or something like that in the future. The game is still technically in beta. has been for like 10 years now. So, uh it's nice that they have this though. It's nice that they added this. Otherwise, you'd have to play like single player Tarov, SP Tarov, Emu Tarov, one of those. And they would they don't like that very much. That that's against the terms of service and and if you especially if you make a video about it on YouTube, you can get dinged. Be careful. Eventually, last I recall, they're hoping to add mods to this and maybe some like generally hosted servers. Some co-op. You can do co-op, right? Yeah, you can do co-op, but generally if you're looking for the most immersive experience, that one's going to be it. I mean, it is by far the best extraction experience, most immersive, most indepth experience that you're going to get out of any of these. But with that PVE experience available now, if you're a dad, if you don't have a,000 hours to put into the game every week, I mean, nobody does technically, but if you don't have all that time to put into the game, all that effort, all that understanding to to learn, uh, you can experience this and it's going to be just a tad easier. You're not going to have to worry so much about other players. And there's going to be geared Chads in there that that are just bots that you're just going to and uh you'll feel good about yourself and grab their gear hopefully. Anyway, even if you do grab this just for the PvE experience, I would recommend hopping in for PvP because that that can be a lot of fun. Tarov is just it's got a vibe that no other game can touch. It's got an experience that no other game is going to be able to offer at this time because everything else just feels feels like a knockoff of Tarov. Not that they are not that they are. They're they're all they've all got different audiences, but but tarov the environments. You've got numerous amount of maps that you can progress through. You've got a bajillion quests. You've got a bajillion guns. You've got bajillion ways to modify your weapon. And you know, you just it's fun. I can't I can't deny it. As much as I think that they've done some silly things, I can't deny it. It's the best thing on the market. And that's why if you play it, you are the Chad debt because you are starting or going to experience where it all begins, where where the the core gameplay loop of the extraction shooter genre really got refined and released. Cuz technically you could argue like The Division was the first extraction shooter, which was great, but it it doesn't provide a hardcore experience like this. You could buy the entire game PvE, PvP. You'd get uh arena, which is their arena shooter, which is always kind of a strange concept to me. You'll get a bunch of season passages, a bunch of stuff. You can purchase the unheard edition at $250. If you're doing that, you're probably you're probably not watching this video to this point anyway. You've probably already spent your $17 that you had free on incursion Red River, which to each their own, man. I mean, if you if you got money to throw around and you want to do that, I that's fine with me. I just personally I would never spend $250 on any game. No shame. I've just got other things that I gota gotta keep up with. Groceries, man. Geez, what a what an expense in 2025. Anyway, some things that you should know if you've gotten through that list. If you're still here, I I want you to know that these games are going to be pretty hardcore. They're going to have lower time to kill. They're going to be fairly realistic because that's what I'm into. That's the kind of stuff that I enjoy. That's the kind of games that I want to dive into for the most part. I am like a a modern hardcore firsterson shooter kind of guy. That's my vibe. So So if you think anything on this list is dumb, that's fine. You're just you're probably just not we're just not vibing. Okay, we just we're not going to work out. I mean, at least not with this list, okay? Not yet. Just give me a chance, though. Hit that subscribe button. But I do feel like the extraction genre really just gives you the best experience that that you can have gaming. I mean, it's like a it's like a battle royaleish style of experience, but you know, more more compact. It's it's chopped up a little bit more cuz I love battle roy because of the intensity they bring. A lot of people do. And these extraction shooters offer kind of a slice to that. Uh, and some somewhat slower as well. You don't have to worry so much about getting to a specific location to to beat everybody, right? It's more of I'm going to go at my own pace. I'm going to slow things down. If you get caught running across an open field, that's sort of your own fault. You learn and you go slower next time. So, generally, I mean, you can you can play these games for a few hours a night. Uh or you could play it for a few hours a week. You can go at your own pace with these games. And that's sort of the where I wanted to to to land. That's sort of what I wanted to help you with because as a dad or as a working uh guy that just doesn't have a ton of time to game anymore. I wanted to give you something that was going to help you and give you something that's just kind of relaxing. Most of these unfortunately are just on a PC. So if you don't have a PC, I mean I guess you've got Hunt Showdown and maybe someday Arena Breakout Infinite, but other than that there's not Try Vigor, I guess. I don't know. There's some Armory Forger mods as well. Well, I should probably I should probably do a video on that. Either way, thank you so much for watching. I'm going to conclude this video. I appreciate the time that you've spent with me today. If you're still here, hit that like button if you liked it. Hit that dislike button if you didn't like it. Subscribe for more.
