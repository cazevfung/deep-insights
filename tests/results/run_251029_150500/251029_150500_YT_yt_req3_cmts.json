    "It was Myth 2 not Marathon that almost sunk the company, minor correction there.",
    "when proximity chat came out in tarkov i ran into a player , we both emptied our mags at point blank range. we both lived, he said \"yea we fucking suck\" and we went our own way, peak gaming cinema",
    "In the last 15 years, we’ve seen the industry do the following to us: Overhype games that launch in unplayable states that take months to be fixed Paywall multiplayer behind “online passes” to milk extra cash out of pre owned games Introduce nickel and dime microtransactions Force gambling mechanics into their games to milk more money out of microtransactions Hide play to win weapons, armor, and boosters into their gambling mechanics Run beloved franchises into the ground with lazy entries full of predatory monetization with no substance Hijack social political fads on social media to use as both advertising campaigns, and shields to avoid criticism Repeatedly attack established fanbases for speaking their minds Remove DLC content that was already paid for without offering refunds Delist games from digital storefronts Remove features from games after launch All of this… and people wonder why players are negative towards games that haven’t released yet?",
    "\"This game is not for you\" \"Wait, why aren't you guys buying it?\"",
    "Bungie saying this game isn't for destiny players is their \"you guys don't have phones?\" Moment",
    "Its almost poetic how the cinematic short shows a vibrant world that suddenly collapsed without explanation and now the only things that remain are replaceable shells that are scavenging what little remains in a world thats beautiful but empty...",
    "Bungie: We don't have Prox chat to avoid toxicity. Bungie: Makes Marathon an Extraction Shooter, which is basically Radium the game mode.",
    "The death of narrative driven FPS games has to be one of the greatest tragedies of modern gaming. I LOVED narrative shooters. I am so bad at pvp, but I'd pop into crucible in destiny just to mess around and still enjoy it, but was ready to get back to the story. We used to have Half-Life, Bioshock, System Shock, Halo, old CoD campaigns when the weren't ass. I loved those games, but the only modern one I can think of is Doom, and I guess Borderlands, but take2 can take a hike as far as I'm concerned.",
    "Blizzard, \"Lets not add any single player to overwatch 2\" Almost everyone quits. Bungie, \"Hey lets only make multi player, sounds like a good idea.\"",
    "Gamers: Use pattern recognition. Game devs and Journalists: So that's not an intended game mechanic. You shouldn't use that.",
    "marathon looks like the kind of VR game they'd put in a black mirror episode",
    "VoIP in tarkov is so great. I remember one time me and my buddy running through Woods and all the sudden hear a voice saying “im right here dont shoot” and watching a chad step out from the bushes. He let us know there was some people shooting up ahead and we grouped up and took them down",
    "The reason they chose to go with a hero system when customizable runners would have made more sense from a narrative, stylistic, and gameplay perspective, is because hero's are mostly just vessels to sell $20 skins.",
    "The \"I don't get/understand the hate\" comments are exhausting, especially when people are literally explaining why they don't like what's been shown.",
    "2030 is going to be a new golden era of gaming as major companies have now gotten a taste of their own mortality",
    "I can't believe studios that benefit from a safety net based on brand always decide to either A) damage their own brand or B) abuse that safety net by dropping on it like an meteor. Their blind chase for \"bigger games, bigger profits\" has been dissolving their ability to make more dense and inspired games from the top down. They are willing to waste hundreds of millions of dollars in 10 or even 100 games, thinking \"if we can just succeed once we can make a profit still\", but will that be the case after 200 games? 300 games? How many hundreds of billions of dollars do they have to waste collectively on games that release still born?",
    "\"This game is all the rage! Let's start making one today and release it in 8 years!\"",
    "‘You don’t abandon your built in audience to chase after one that was never there to begin with.’ This is LITERALLY the very definition of Disney Star Wars.",
    "As a long time Bungie fan and Destiny player BEWARE! They sold us a $60 game with Destiny 2 then, gutted the original campaign and the best expansion to date and made the game “free to play.” Bungie slowly but surely re sold the “content” they stole from the player base and never gave the original campaign back for new players to enjoy. They cannot be trusted and now want to charge $40 in a space that is free to play and will certainly charge you through the nose for cosmetics and battle passes. This game will probably be free to play sooner than later and I think it’s hilarious that they are making a game where they constantly take all the cool stuff you collected away from you routinely. They have perfected the art of paying for things you will never own…..",
    "Can we have some PvE? No, who the fuck would want to play PvE? Idk, maybe the some of the 3 million people who purchased Helldivers, but what the fuck do I know.",
    "They’ve trained gamers to hate anything that remotely touches upon trends for the “modern audience”. We want to have fun. If you can provide it we’ll toss money at you. If not, then then we won’t spend a couple days worth of pay at it.",
    "Imagine telling Destiny 2 players \"this game isn't made for you\" after only inviting huge D2 streamers to play Marathon in its prey alpha stage",
    "\"I am never going to forgive you for taking away content I paid for\". Well said. I will never touch anything Bungie ever does unless they refund me the DLC they stole.",
    "In an era where boomer shooters are making a big comeback, they decide to revive their much-loved narrative driven boomer shooter franchise... as a hero based PvPvE extraction shooter. First: WHAT? Second: THE F**K? These industry people are so clueless it HURTS. Creating a boomer shooter with the pedigree of the Marathon trilogy and the graphical fidelity and polish of a AAA budget, capable of competing with the likes of the DOOM franchise, would practically be a license to print money. It's absolutely insane they decided to go in this direction. They very well could've added this in as a game play mode on top of a strong single player game (like Titanfall 2 did) if they really wanted the game to have it, but no, THIS IS IT. Whomever made this decision needs to be fired, preferably out of a cannon, because their stupidity cannot be overstated enough.",
    "Ive seen people saying \"its not even in pre alpha, a lot can change\" and \" stop judging when its not even done\" My brother in christ it comes out in 6 monthes",
    "As a trans person, I'm sick of massive corporations trying to use me and people like me to try and gain social currency without any actual interest in our culture or place in this world we currently live in. I love seeing trans people and androgyny in games, but somehow companies like Bungie or Target or whoever else make it feel hollow and placative. And none of us even care for it. And further more, trying to use us as a shield is just damaging to us. Look at how public view on us is these days. We just want to play our silly little games in peace like the rest of yall, and now everyone hates us. I get fucking attacked or insulted on the street once a month, as do all of my friends. we're fucking scared to go outside to even get groceries.",
    "A Doom 2016 style Marathon reboot/sequel would have been awesome. There's clearly a market for 90's style single player FPS, but I guess that just isn't an infinite source of revenue, so it's out of the question.",
    "the funniest moment was when the devs said \"we want to make a safe space for players\" while advertising their PLAYER VERSUS PLAYER COMPETITIVE SHOOTER",
    "My first thought when watching the Marathon trailer was the meme \"How is this supposed to help us sell hamburgers?\" Some people/companies seem to believe that vague and cryptic storytelling automatically make it more compelling and mysterious. In the case of marathon they crossed an invisible line that entered into \"so confusing it's boring\" territory.",
    "This video is spot on. But it's 27 minutes of repeating the same points again, and again, and again.",
    "As soon as bungie said marathon is an extraction shooter I immediately stopped giving a shit about this game",
    "I was an admin of a very active 90 man clan on Destiny 2 and immediately walked away the day they sunset for the first time. It was a slap in the face I couldn't ignore that resulted in one of the best decisions I've made gaming.",
    "I'm a hunt showdown guy, more than 1500 hours, and your video is on point regarding how I feel about this game, even about the part of the character design I bought a PS4 for Destiny 1 and bloodborne, I was a halo guy on the 360 era and I agree with everything you've said, the bottom line is trust, they lost mine and that's why this backlash exist."
