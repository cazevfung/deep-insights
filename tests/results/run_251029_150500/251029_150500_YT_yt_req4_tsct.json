  "content": "Am I going to play Marathon? Probably. Probably. It just It just comes down to like what the timing of things. You're so full of When the game comes out, you'll be all over it. Brother, let me tell you something. Just like Destiny, we're like a news reporter on the scene of disaster. So, yeah, of course we're of course we're going to be there. We've got it covered. I've actually like really come around to extraction shooters. I think the two that I Arc Raiders and Exoborn are the two that are like the most standout extractions for me so far. And so Marathon's got a it's got a hell of a hill to climb here for me. It's going to have to do something that really pops off to outweigh those especially Arc Raiders. No, it's interesting you bring this up, guys, about Marathon. Where is that article, guys? All right, so this was this was the article right here. Arc Raiders director says that Bundy's marathon test was a very great AB test that helped Embark see what worked and what didn't. Also called its art style very evocative. I hope to see more of that in the future. All right, so if you're wondering what like we'll let the article just explain. So from Abdullah right here, Arc Raiders designer director Virgil Watkins says Bungie's troubled marathon test became a great AB test that helped Embark refine what worked and what didn't for its own upcoming extraction shooter. Bungie's Marathon might not have had the best first impressions earlier this year, but over at Embark Studios, the game still played a valuable role, just not in the way you'd expect. Oh, it played a hell of a role. No, we we'll talk about in just a moment cuz these these two things happened from the first play test from Marathon into our graders's uh play test. And guess what? Marathon went first. So, it was actually a great opportunity for Embark to see like what are all the potential upups, if you know what I mean. Earlier this year, Bungie rolled out his first closed alpha play test for Marathon, his upcoming extracted shooter. The feedback wasn't pretty. The test was met with mixed and negative reaction from players who expected more from the long-awaited reboots. Many criticized that the game was missing key features that you expect in an extraction shooter game. Add to that the now infamous art theft controversy where Marathon's art director had to publicly apologize after an art assets were found in the alpha build of the game. directly ripped from an indie artist without permission. Since then, the game has been stuck in recovery mode with a delayed release and a new round of invite only testing running this week. Meanwhile, Lmark Studios Arc Raiders has been having a much better time. That's an understatement. The free-to-play project turned premium extraction shooter just wrapped up its biggest server slam weekend, pulling in around 190,000 concurrent players on Steam and landing in the platform's top three sellers. Now, Virgil Watkins, the design director on Arc Raiders, says that Marathon's disaster test actually helped Embark sharpen its own design director. Marathon test helped Arc Raiders compare and contrast key design ideas. Speaking to PC Gamer, Watkins said the overlapping release for Bungie's Marathon Test and Embarked Play Test for Arc Raiders was a coincidence, giving both studios a rare opportunity to learn from each other's choices. The quote, \"It was very coincidental that they had their tests around the time we did.\" Walkin said, \"To my knowledge, I don't think any of us knew that was going to happen.\" It was a very great AB test for us because obviously they made decisions that we didn't and vice versa. So, we could kind of compare and contrast how some of those things shook out. Look, I'm not saying that most of us weren't hyped for Arc Raiders, but do you feel like Marathon rolling out first in their play tests really missing the mark kind of almost pushed us to take a look at Arc Raiders more? We would have played both regardless. It's not about whether or not you would have played both. It's about your thoughts afterwards, your experience, and you saw it was such such polar experiences between the two. You had one game that was very much still needing to be cooked, and then you had another game that was very much refined. And despite even being in that refined state, it didn't roll out until now or until here in another week. Now, it's quite interesting to follow up in what players thought about those certain things or what did work in their context and didn't and what may have worked in ours. Watkins added that Embar didn't pick apart Marathon with a magnifying glass, especially since Bungie's test was limited in scope, but he was rooting for it to succeed. He also complimented Bungie's visual approach, calling Marathon's art style very evocative, and says he's genuinely curious to see how the project evolves. I'm personally curious to see how that ends up. I hope to see more of that in the future, he said. Let me just say, as a studio, this is exactly how you're supposed to be. And I'm not talking about like rooting for the other studio. It's just purely acknowledging your competition. I saw this unfold with like Anthem and Boware and EA. Y'all remember that that article that broke from Shrier, how Boware wasn't even allowed to or devs at Boware weren't allowed to talk about the competition, most notably Destiny 2, while they were making Anthem. How can you make a looter shooter if you don't look through your competition and see what works and and what doesn't? And they obviously saw here with Marathon that features like solo play, proximity chat, obviously not having those things present just completely blew up in Bungie's face. Now with Arc Raiders just days away, Embark clearly feels confident in Insurrection. On the other side, Bungie still needs to build player trust. Developers holding a closed tech test later this week. As for what's changed on Marathon since it closed alpha test, the game post exclusive report of several updates and developers have implemented, including the long requested proximity chat, new runners, the UEC marathon ship map, and how it works and more. Can I just say this guys? What if this past summer, despite how terrible it was, despite so many features being missing, and despite having to watch one of the most uncomfortable streams ever, where Bungie had to come out and publicly acknowledge that yes, art had been stolen, what if that was the best thing for Marathon? Because a September launch, in my opinion, would have been disastrous for him. And all of these features would have been added months after the initial launch. At least now we're going to get I don't want I don't want to say a complete package, but a more complete package. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you got to get, you know, I felt like and then and then seeing Arc Raiders, you look you're looking across, you see your competition, you see the type of product they're putting out. You see Arc Raiders about to roll out with not four but five maps. The fifth map's supposed to come sometime after launch. I mean, dude, you got to pick your game up. And like Bungie has always been like a lot of people have applauded like the PVE side on Bungie, right? the raids, their dungeons, and everything else. But I got to say, guys, the enemy AI in Arc Raiders is some of the best I've ever had to deal with. They're all over the place, but it makes every engagement so different. What I'm hoping is that Bungie is looking squarely at Arc Raiders and going, \"All right, we've got to pick up our game in these areas to compete against Arc Raiders.\" And of course, other games that have well established communities. Competition good. Makes both products better. Agreed. Well, I will say this. I think a lot of people definitely have a hate boner for for you know, Marathon. Dude, this is I keep coming back to this, man. Bungie unintentionally or I don't know what they kind of weaponize their own community against themselves. This isn't this isn't like Soulframe and Warframe where Warframe players are, you know, are they're rooting for Soulframe and its success. And then when you see streams from DE, they're doing streams showing off Warframe and they're moving into Soulframe and they're talking about what they learned from Warframe, which has transitioned into Soulframe, and you feel like you're part of one big family. Again, you removed all PvP updates essentially from Destiny PvP. You didn't even give us maps until we just damn near we we were demanding. Everyone was demanding it. And then the first thing we hear about marathon and your vioc was how important the integrity of PvP is to you which is why marathon will be getting dedicated servers. There was nothing what should have been said in that moment. We understand how important the integrity of PvP is in all of our games. So therefore, we will be rolling out dedicated servers for Marathon when it launches and for Destiny now. You've turned your community against you. And that's not even including the competition you got to go up against. Now listen, I hope it's going to be a good game. We'll definitely be playing it. We'll see, man. We'll see. We'll see if it lives up. And I I hope it exceeds all of our expectations. I will say by that point, Tarov will be on Steam, right? I'm pretty sure Tarov is coming to Steam here pretty soon. Arc raiders will be very much entrrenched with their community and we'll just see man. We'll see what shakes out. Has someone enjoyed marathon play test? The launch initially being September it up. Also the art scandal. I mean I enjoyed marathon but I don't I'm going to be honest. The the first play test I didn't see myself playing it after that first week. And what happened? Who were the people that were still playing the marathon play test? The small marathon community and they're there but Destiny players. I would say Destiny players were the only ones still playing that thing after the first few days. Marathon was fine. Fine just won't cut it. Fine won't cut it, guys. That's what I'm trying to say, man. Fine is not going to drag someone away. That is like Tarov players. Have y'all talked to Tarov players? Some of you are in the stream right now. You guys areing crazy about Tarov. You're not going to drag away Tarov players with just fine. You can't just You can't just throw up some It's all right. It's uh it's sci-fi, you know what I mean? That ain't going to pull them the away. And look, our greatest players, they're going to be the exact same thing. Marathon's going to have to do something special. And yeah, I am I am concerned. I hope they cook, man. I hope they cook. They should abandon what they're doing. Start converting Marathon into Destiny 3. Not going to happen, guys. Not going to happen. That shit's going out. And honestly, I wish Marathon was coming out this year. Like, I wish it could come out December or January or something. You know what I mean? I just want it out. I just want it out here in front of us. And for no other reason than just get it out the door, it either sinks or swim one or the other. And look, nothing nothing would make me happier and I truly mean this. Nothing would make me happier than marathon rolling outs and it is a massive success. Iting kills it, brother. We'll turn. Nothing would make me happier than less calling me being like, \"Hey man, are you playing marathon tonight?\" yeah. Hell yeah. I'll be on this evening. Nothing would make me happy than the boys calling me. Hey man, are you doing marathon this weekend? Yeah, let's hit it. Be nice if it's successful enough to fund a D3. Dude, at this rate, by the time a D3 comes out, if it ever comes out, I'm going to have a kid in college. You know what I'm saying? Slap that like button like your mama told you, right? with you. Heat. Am I going to play Marathon? Probably. Probably. It just It just comes down to like what the timing of things. You're so full of When the game comes out, you'll be all over it. Brother, let me tell you something. Just like Destiny, we're like a news reporter on the scene of disaster. So, yeah, of course we're of course we're going to be there. We've got it covered.
