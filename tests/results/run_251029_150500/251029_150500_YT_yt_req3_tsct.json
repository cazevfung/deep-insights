  "content": "Don't make fun of me for the minor sunburn. I looked out the window for 5 seconds and this was the result of it. But it's been wild for me to sit back and watch as people have been visibly confused over the reception of Bungie's upcoming game Marathon. And I've seen writers, I've seen journalists, I've seen commentators and content creators and fans all sitting back going, \"I'm just so sick of how toxic things have become. How could you be so critical of something that's not even out yet?\" It's almost like we haven't been for the better part of the last decade watching as these companies have been torching their reputation at both ends while also at the exact same time bending these players over backwards taking advantage of them. You want these guys to be optimistic. What? Marathon doesn't have an uphill battle. It has a mountain to climb and that's not a mountain that the players put there. That's an obstacle Bungie put there. It's not that Marathon as a game conceptually can't find an audience. I do think an audience is there for it. How big that is. That's a completely different story, but its biggest issues aren't tied to the game. It's tied to Bungie. So today, what I want to do is I want to talk about the negative discourse that's surrounding Marathon right now. I want to talk about why it is the way that it is. I want to talk about how Sony and Bungie have essentially clipped its wings before it can even fly. And I'd like to talk about whether or not Marathon can run or fall flat on its face. Spoiler, it's going to be a little bit of both. Just last week, Bungie finally pulled back the curtain on their upcoming extraction shooter, Marathon. A name that echoes from the depths of the studios past. For those that are unfamiliar, Marathon wasn't just one of Bungie's earliest projects. It was their beginning. Originally developed for the Mac in the mid '90s, the Marathon Trilogy gave Bungie its first taste of recognition, but it also nearly killed them. One of the games in the series was shipped with a critical error that, no exaggeration, was wiping players hard drives upon installation. The backlash for this was catastrophic. Bungie was drowning in returns and on the verge of bankruptcy. And to survive, they ended up cutting a deal with Microsoft and in exchange for covering the damages, Bungie would develop a new project for Microsoft and their upcoming console, the original Xbox. That project was Halo. So, in a way, Marathon was both the origin of Bungie's fame and their near-death experience that then forced them into pivoting into a franchise that made them into legends. Now, here we are three decades later. They're dusting off that legacy, and they're gambling with fate all over again. Now, this new marathon, controversially enough, is set to be a three-player squad-based PVEP extraction shooter. Players are going to be taking on the role of runners, humans that have abandoned their mortal bodies for sleek cybernetic shells, chasing fame and fortune across the ruins of Taetti. After a mysterious calamity had wiped out the planet's researchers, corporations had stepped in, sponsoring these runners to come in and scavenge whatever's left, tech, data, secrets, whatever they can get their hands on. Players are going to battle with hostile AI sentinels, alien threats, and other squads in a race to, well, extract before being wiped out. Bungie has also gone on to hint a little bit more at larger scale events as well. Boss encounters, dungeons, maybe even some Destiny style raids if we're lucky that might be hiding underneath the surface of this game. Now, on paper, this should have been a slam dunk. A major studio with one of the strongest FPS pedigrees in all of gaming, reviving a long, dormant IP, creating a very distinctl looking sci-fi world within a genre that really isn't all that overcrowded. Five or six years ago, I think this would have lit the gaming world on fire. But times have changed, my friends, and this game's reception couldn't have been any colder. Instead of hype, the announcement was met with skepticism, sarcasm, and exhaustion. Twitter, Reddit, YouTube, go ahead and pick your platform. Doesn't really matter where you're looking, because very few players were impressed, and even fewer were optimistic. Day overday, as more information has been revealed, the backlash against both Bungie and Marathon has only gotten worse. I think the first red flag of this reveal was the genre itself. Marathon is a hero-based extraction shooter. That alone is going to raise some eyebrows. While Bungie definitely has a long history of being praised for its PvP and Halo and Destiny, what's truly made them who they are is their PvE content. Say what you will about Destiny's monetization and its seasonal bloat. Believe me, we'll talk about that later. But there is a reason why their raids and dungeons are considered the gold standard for MMO styled action combat. Beyond that, keep in mind that this game doesn't seem to have any narrative and it's not going to feature any type of PVE cooperative modes. Yet Bungie has built their entire empire on cinematic storytelling, memorable characters, and finely tuned cooperative play. So, this sudden pivot into a genre that appeals to a completely different audience of player just doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. It doesn't align with what their audience wants. It feels like trend chasing, plain and simple. And on top of that, the extraction shooter genre is brutal. There are really only what, two success stories that we have, Escape from Tarov and Hunt Showdown. Nearly every other attempt has faceplanted after launch because these games are niche by design. They're not meant to be easily digestible or streamlined experiences. Their very appeal lies in their punishing loops, the tension, the messiness, the lack of handholding. The moment you try to sand off the edges to appeal to a broader audience, you kill what makes these games special. Simplify the loot in the game feels hollow. Add revives and you cut the stakes. Throw in flashy abilities and you undermine player skill. any of these changes tells fans of that genre that this studio doesn't understand what they're building and Bungie is already making all of those changes. I mean, case in point, there's no proximity chat in Marathon because according to Bungie, it would be way too toxic. I am so sick of this, by the way. This constant desire to soften and sanitize the edges of every gaming experience. This isn't making games safer, it's making them less interesting. The only thing that's safe about them is nobody's going to be playing them. In an extraction shooter, proximity chat isn't just flavor, it's function. It creates emergent, unforgettable moments. I cannot tell you guys how many times I've run into another player while playing Escape from Tarov. Adrenaline pumping. We're awkwardly trying to negotiate a ceasefire. Maybe we part ways peacefully. Maybe we actually team up. Maybe we betray each other in the next 5 minutes. That tension, that unpredictability, that's what makes this genre. Bungie stripping it out in the name of safety shows that either they don't get it or they're too afraid to embrace it. Now, if that wasn't enough, and I really love this part. I love when these developers do this. But when fans were asking if the game would include more PvE focused content, maybe offer some options down the road for players that want something more cooperative over competitive encounters, Bungie responded with, oh, everybody's favorite line, \"This game isn't made for you.\" Telling fans of Destiny PvE that they don't recommend Marathon to them. Seriously, that's the message that you guys want to be sending to the Destiny community. The same people that have funded the game that you're making right now through years of support, expansions, and microtransactions that they purchased in Destiny 2. Bungie isn't just ignoring their core audience here. They are actively alienating them. It is baffling to me how many of these studios continue to make the exact same mistake, treating genuine questions like they're nuisances instead of an opportunity. Maybe, just maybe, if Bungie was paying attention, they would realize that players generally like the idea of a PvE focused experience where they can then take what they earn into a more highstakes PvP mode. It's the one thing that players have been waiting for and they've been wanting to get from Tarov. And arguably, Bungie has the better skill set to deliver. Imagine of having a co-op PvE exploration mode or narrative mode where you can go and build your wealth, skill, and arsenal and then go and take that into an extraction mode where there's more risk, where there's more reward, where the challenge is even greater. Players want that. That sounds like a great game that a lot of people would want to play. I do not understand how you miss a layup like this. Now, you're sitting there saying to yourself, \"It just can't get any worse, LD. It can't get worse.\" Baby, it's 2025. Of course it can. Marathon, while only launching with six playable characters and three maps, is not going to be free to play. It's a premium title, and not only will players have to pay upfront, the game will also launch with battle passes, microtransactions, and premium content. Bungie said it would be a premium product and through their official marathon Twitter later then clarified saying that it won't be full price and details will come later likely pointing to Sony's strategy of pricing live service titles around $40 like Hell Divers 2 Foam Stars and Concord noticing that only one of those games survived. Now I've seen a lot of people trying to defend this and I got something to say to you by the way people making comparisons to Hell Divers 2. You clearly haven't played it. That game earned its $40 price tag through ethical monetization and great gameplay. Every cosmetic, every battle pass, every microtransaction in Hell Divers 2 can be earned through gameplay. Their battle passes don't expire. The grind is fair. Players feel respected. That's the key. Bungie, on the other hand, has one of the worst reputations in the entire industry for monetization. Between Destiny 2's constantly shifting economy, disappearing content, and overpriced cosmetics, there is no reason at all to believe that Marathon will offer anything close to the level of goodwill of Hell Divers 2. Sony saw the success of Hell Divers 2 and took the wrong lesson. They saw the price point, not the philosophy behind it. I guess at least we can say that Sony did learn one good lesson from Hell Divers 2, and they will not be requiring players to have a PlayStation account on PC or Xbox to be able to play Marathon. So, what's my take on all this? Honestly, I like these kind of games. I genuinely do. I dig the aesthetic. The world looks really intriguing, and I know Bungie's gunplay is still some of the best in the business. With that said, I'm incredibly skeptical whether or not they can pull this off. I do not like the hero shooter angle. Those character designs look painfully weak. The gameplay looks painfully slow. They are charging a premium price. They are known for predatory monetization and they are already making compromises on what makes this sort of game special. You guys are entering into one of the most competitive and unforgiving markets in this industry. The bodies of dead live service games stretch as high as the unemployment lines are long and you're making a bet on a genre that has far more casualties than it does successes. But you guys think you can do it better. I feel like this is just another chapter in this industry's ongoing identity crisis. We've reached the tail end of the battle royale boom. These publishers are now scrambling trying to figure out what comes next. Extraction shooters to them seem like the next big experiment, but I don't think they're it. They're just too niche for a broad audience, and broad audiences aren't what Bungie is trying to target. Most players are going to lean hard in either one side or the other, either PvE or PvP focused games. Forcing both of them together narrows that appeal, and any compromise that you're going to make to try to cater to one side or the other ultimately will ruin this game for everyone. Now, that's not to say that Marathon can't find success, but I do think the kind of success that Bungie and Sony are banking on is a fantasy, especially if they're charging a premium price on top of battle passes and microtransactions. You're putting up a payw wall around a game that lives or dies by player engagement. It makes no sense to me. You are actively pushing away the very people that might have just tried the game out of curiosity. People who might have liked it, stuck around, and maybe even brought their friends with them. Now, I realize this is going to be a relatively cold take, but I just do not see the logic in charging an upfront cost for something that is effectively a free-to-play model. When your business depends on keeping players around for the long term, the only thing that matters is how many people you can get in the door and how long you can keep them there. I'm going to tell it to you guys straight. I think a lot of people are preaching platitudes when it comes to this game. I think that Sony spent $400 million on Concord. How much are they willing to spend on a Bungie live service title? I would guarantee there's some serious cash that flew into this. Not only that, but they spent $3 billion acquiring that company. They cannot afford for this game to be niche. But that's exactly what this game is going to be because that's just what this genre is. And keep in mind that Destiny 2 has not been financially viable or at least not as profitable as Sony needed it to be when they purchased Bungie for that $3 billion. So yeah, this can't be a niche game. It needs to be a breakout hit. They needed to be a Hell Divers 2. They needed no they needed to be a Marvel rivals or even something bigger than that and maintain that speed, not just have it fall off after a week or two or something like that. This already looks like a high-risisk gamble in a genre that just cannot compete with the kind of numbers that both Sony and Bungie are going to be looking for. And you're already giving players plenty of reasons not to even try the game, let alone play it. I'm just saying try it or even be interested in it. $40 for a live service game with all of the trappings, no proximity chat. What are you guys thinking? Who's making these decisions? You know, ironically, if I was a publisher and I wanted to make a profitable live service game, you know what I would make? Destiny, but just not Destiny or Warframe. I think there is a general genuine hunger from players that want an MMO light action RPG experience that doesn't have players that have 10 years of experience in front of them. They want a even start. They want to be on the ground level with everybody else. And I think that the First Descended show that I I think that it also showed that if your game's not good, the players aren't going to stick around. But I think that showed a general hunger for something in the live service market that isn't there right now or at least players aren't seeing that's there. And for Marathon, I just don't see that same kind of draw. And I don't think this money, sorry, I don't think this game is going to make its money back. I just don't see it happening. Now, with that said, I still think that this launch is going to be a big deal. Bungie's name still carries weight. We're talking about the people that made Halo and Destiny, and for a lot of people, that's all you're going to need. there going to be people that are going to line up to buy this game just off of the name alone. Not a lot of people are involved in these kind of conversations. We saw the same kind of thing with Assassin's Creed Shadows, though we don't necessarily know exactly how profitable or how popular that game actually is, but it makes a lot of sense as to why people would be confused by the general discourse surrounding Marathon right now. They see the negativity. They see the identity politics and things like that, the heavy-handed criticisms, and they all look at it and ask, you know, why are you rooting for something to fail that's not even out yet? And I think boiling down all that into toxic, like toxicity and ideological hate misses the point entirely. People do not trust Bungie and people do not trust Sony and you're putting them in the same room together. And that just that's not a good combination. That's not what players are looking for. And I think that this game is going to show them it is going to both of these companies are going to suffer the consequences of taking advantage of the very players that they need for this game to succeed. Trust has been a reoccurring theme in some of my recent videos, and Marathon might be the best case study yet that we've seen for what happens to a studio when it's burned through it entirely. what the media, publishers, developers, and even other players often miss out on. It's not just the tone that matters when it comes to criticism. It's the source. Where is all of this unrest coming from? As a studio, your foundation for your next game should be the players that you already have. You build trust with them. You reward their loyalty. You grow from there. You do not abandon them to go chase an audience that you never even had, especially when that audience that you do have is already skeptical. But that's exactly what Bungie is doing here because I don't think that Destiny players want Marathon and I don't think the outsiders looking in are any more convinced after seeing how Bungie treats its own customers and their staff. They have turned their reputation into a currency and they've spent all of it. Sure, some criticisms may be hyperbolic and yeah, in today's political climate, it's easy to fall back on ideological explanations, but let's set all of that aside for a second. Look at what's actually going on here. Let's look at the history here. Look at Destiny 2. Why would anyone trust Bungie? Why would anyone want to get excited for their next game? Destiny 2 brought with it a slow, relentless shift into predatory monetization. In-game rewards were stripped away and moved into the Eververse store. Then came content vaulting. An entire expansion that players had paid for, removed from the game. No refunds, no apologies, no real benefit for the players. Then they started sunsetting weapons that players had grinded for, invalidating progress, all in the name of balance, only for them to reverse course on that later. Then Sony bought them for $3.6 billion. Players were promised. They were told that things would get better. More transparency, faster content, better communication. Instead, monetization got worse, content got buggier, and the development cycle slowed to a crawl. Then came the layoff. Sony started gutting the studio, cutting narrative leads, and veteran developers. The same people who built what fans loved were then tossed aside. Reports of crunch, discrimination, and a toxic workplace then followed. Lawsuits then after that, all coming from a studio that constantly paraded around its progressive values in public, but apparently all for nothing. And after all of that, what do players get? They got Lightfall, a broken, bloated, recycled expansion that felt more like filler and cost the same as a fullpriced title. You know, let's not forget that this is the same Bungie that charges $150 for a free-to-play game, though Steam estimates it'll cost you over $450 if it's not all in a bundle for Destiny 2. There are battle passes, paid dungeons, cosmetic bundles, event cards, paywalled expansions, and a $60 expansion cycle. While it definitely seems that the game's latest expansion was received well, why would players be excited for anything that Bungie then puts out after this? They don't trust them, and frankly, they shouldn't. There's no loyalty left, no goodwill, just the appearance of a studio that's looking for new ways to squeeze the last few dollars out of whoever's left around. This is one of the reasons why they keep losing players. And when you treat players like disposable wallets, you can't be surprised when they treat your next project like a joke. Bungie and Sony are gambling with their franchises, betting everything on growth, on shareholder satisfaction, on live service revenue. But you don't build trust by gambling. You build it with respect. And right now, that respect is gone. And look, I get it. I know that the discourse around games has gotten more toxic, but so has the way that players have been treated. Studios are demanding more money, offering less value, and when players push back, they're dismissed. They're mocked. They're told that this game isn't made for you. This isn't about ideology. This is the direct result of corporate bloat of chasing endless growth in an industry that's already overextended. Eventually, you're going to hit a ceiling. You're going to outpace your own audience. And when you can't pull in any more players, the only thing that's left to do is to bleed the ones that you already have dry. How can you blame these players for being skeptical or negative when they're treated this way? I mean, if we take the time to look at all these criticisms through a lens of distrust, it all starts to make sense. Take Marathon's character designs. I personally do not find them appealing. Nothing about them really grabs me. But I do understand what Bungie is going for here. This is a transhumanist universe where people have just given up on humanity. Think Cyberpunk 2077, but another 800 years later. These people have cycled through death and rebirth until the point that they don't even know who they are anymore. These characters aren't supposed to look human, masculine, or feminine because canotically they've lost touch with that. And this is the point that I think a lot of people miss is that nuance is lost on a skeptical audience. They are not going to assume the best, they're going to assume the worst. I've seen the accusations, the backlash about androgyny, the character designs, the questions about who's leading the project. Some of it is ideological. Sure, without a doubt. But all of it, no. I don't think it's all about gender or identity. I think it's about trust. Players have been watching and they've been seeing this song and dance play out for years now. We've watched as countless studios have injected gender ideology as a smokeokc screen, for weak design, for shallow writing. players have been treated like they're problems that need to be fixed and educated and now they're just going to assume the worst. When you break your bond with your community, when you break that trust that you had with them, even the thoughtful, creative choices that you make are going to get viewed through a lens of suspicion. That's the cost of cashing in on your reputation. That's the cost of breaking your trust. And Marathon is about to show the entire industry just how expensive that cost truly is. I want to illustrate this for you guys because I want people to really understand this. If we change the context of this conversation entirely, we look at a game like Elden Ring or any From Software title really, these games are drenched in body horror, divine transformation, and identity collapse. Characters that are mutating into gods, into beasts, into nothing at all in some cases. While there is clearly masculine and feminine figures within their narratives, the overwhelming aesthetic in these games is androgynous, grotesque, and symbolic more than anything else. Even their character creator uses body type A and body type B rather than traditional gendered language. And yet no outrage, no mass backlash, no claims of agenda or people that are trying to dissect screenshots frame by frame. Well, I guess in some cases with America. But why is this? It's because the audience trusts from software. I genuinely feel like this is what so many people in the industry fail to understand. The backlash rarely starts from the content itself. It almost always starts from the studio behind it. When players feel respected and they feel like they can trust the developers intentions, they're not going to be looking for reasons to criticize. They're invested. They want to believe. They want that game to succeed. But when that studio squanders that trust, players will scrutinize everything. They will attack everything because they are waiting to get burned again. I don't understand how industry veterans and writers are missing out on such an obvious shift in priorities from some of the most successful studios in this industry. Look at the studios that are out there that are earning goodwill right now. Larry Studios dropped one of the best RPGs that we've seen in years in Balders's Gate 3. They sold it at a fair price. They packed it full of content. No microtransactions, no season passes, no DLC. Even when fans were begging for more content, what did Larry do? They added it for free. They refused to monetize their player trust from software. Right now, they're making Elden Ring Night Rey multiplayer focused game. No cash shop, no battle passes or microtransactions. Hello Games has spent years now making No Man's Sky, adding more and more content to it, even when players are begging to give them money. They are dropping massive updates for free, transforming it into something that players actually love. The result, trust, loyalty, excitement. These studios, when they go to announce their next project, these players aren't going to question it. They're not going to brace themselves for disappointment. They are ready to believe. They want to believe it's going to be great. That's the difference. These developers understand that their audience isn't something to be manipulated. It's something to be earned. Now, this may come as a surprise to you guys, but a lot of people from the industry watch these videos. I get a lot of feedback from developers. Hell, I just recently talked to a CEO. You guys are going to be hearing more on that later this week. But if you work for Bungie and you found this video for whatever reason, know that this isn't out of bad faith or anything like that. This is just genuine criticism and I'm being realistic about the position that you guys are in and you have to do something about that. I don't know how you're going to. The clock is ticking. The game releases in September and you have to somehow undo what's been done. You have to somehow regain player trust for a new game. And I just personally don't think that's going to happen. Not with what these players, not with what Destiny players have been subjected to over the years. Bungie, in my eyes, is the ultimate betrayal for gamers. We're talking about a company that has always been on the cutting edge of game design. Some of the best shooters that are out there, some of the best memories that they've created for players worldwide, yet at the exact same time, they are the least ethical studio in my eyes in the entire industry. And it's not even close. I've never seen players treated the way that Destiny players have been treated. I'm one of them. I'm never going to forgive you for taking away content that I paid for without asking. And you know, I realize that the people to blame aren't necessarily the folks that are sitting at the desk that are working on these games. I guarantee there are some hardworking people that are working on Marathon right now. And to be honest with you, they don't they don't deserve what's coming their way. You know who does? The guy that's been spending money like crazy. the one that has $2 million worth of uh classic cars in his garage and also on top of that the company that spent $3 billion on that company. They're the problem in this situation. They're the ones that need to figure something out. I'm going to tell it to you guys straight. I don't think that Marathon is going to flop the same way that Concord did. I think that there's enough brand recognition, enough power that it's way more distinct. It looks cooler in general. I think people will give it a shot. Some people will give it a shot, but ultimately looking at the kind of money that they need to make, keep in mind Destiny 2 is not making the money that Sony needs Bungie to be making. They thought Destiny 2 was going to make more money than it did and it's just consistently lost players almost year after year after year. And if this game comes out and does not meet the expectations of Sony, it's going to suffer the same fate as Concord. They're going to look at the studio. They're going to think about, you know, hey, what's the cheapest way that we can continue to run Destiny 2 and make it profitable and then just gut the rest of the studio, use it as a support or whatever it might be, or probably just lay off everybody to be honest with you. That's just been the trend that this industry has been going in lately. But that's what I foresee. I just don't see it making the money that this company's probably expecting this game to make. Unless they have a bunch of other projects they plan on doing, but I don't think that's the case. Who knows? Maybe I'll be proven wrong. Maybe they make some big changes. Maybe there's some finishing touches they add before the game. Maybe they delay it for a little bit and they give it a little bit of extra love that makes it a little bit more interesting for players. They I don't know, maybe there is a incredibly broad audience that's out there that is looking for a streamlined extraction shooter experience and this game is going to fit right into it and it's just going to blow up. Personally, that sounds like a bit of a fantasy to me, but I guess we'll see. I've been proven wrong in the past. I'm not going to pretend like I'm infallible. Not by any means. But yeah, I hope the game is good. I don't really necessarily want to see it fail because it does have a lot of things that interest me. And if it's fun and it's interesting, then I'm going to enjoy the game. That's basically how I've felt with most of these games that come out. I'm never going to necessarily pray for a game to fail, companies to fail, that's a completely different story. But games themselves, not necessarily, cuz you know, I like having good games to play. But hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you guys did enjoy the video, make sure you guys subscribe to the channel, like the video, drop a comment down below, come follow me on Twitch, hang out. I keep pointing here like I put the sign. I always forget it. You can just check the description or the pin comment or something like that. Uh, yeah, that's it. Stay cool, stay righteous, stay safe. Catch you guys in the next one. Family. Family.",
