    "“A man learns from his mistakes. But a wise man learns from the mistakes of others” lol",
    "\"oh these guys tripped on their own shit, better not do that myself\"",
    "Crazy how studios can be creative, build a game without complaining about it, not plagiarize content multiple times, and have that all work out as a pretty decent effort. Then, there's Bungie. I don't see how they can course correct given a catastrophic inability to self-reflect. Maybe, but history kinda tells us how it will play out.",
    "Embark out here like \"let me remind everyone about the art style right quick so no one forgets.\"",
    "i was so hype for marathon from the trailer but then the gameplay was mid, and then the opposite happened for arc raiders. their trailer was good but the gameplay better in every way measurable",
    "I only knew about ARC raiders when I couldn't get a key into the marathon alpha test. I was extremely upset about not getting in, and as if it was fate, I saw the trailer for ARC's tech test 2, and I never looked back on marathon. I cannot wait for ARC to release and I hope we get many new and innovative updates in the years to come!",
    "I member watching Marathon and thinking things just felt off here and there. Couldn't quite pinpoint or articulate them. Then I watched Arc Raiders when that beta dropped. It was like night and day.",
    "I'm the closed alpha for Marathon right now and well... Can't wait for Arc Raiders in 7 days",
    "Cross comment at the end is sadly very accurate. I'm 32, if D3 comes out in like 5 years im not sure I'll have the time to play it, I barely have time to play other games now. When D1 started I could start playing after job and play until like 3 or 4 Am with friends, sleep like 3 hours and go back to work, then with D2 we could play until midnight every other day, now Im lucky if I get like 2 hours every couple of days... Im not sure if I'll be able to keep up with another live service in a couple of years.",
    "Arc Raiders TT2 was without a doubt, the best game I have played in 10 years. I have never played an extraction shooter either and didn’t even like arc raiders for the first 2 hours. 4 hours in, I was more hooked than any game I’ve ever played. I cannot WAIT for October 30th",
    "Arc Raiders is going to bury marathon and it’s coming back it waaaaay before Exobourne was pretty fun arc definitely got my attention way more",
    "The proof is in the money. Pete parsons left the company as soon as he could so that he could take his bag and run with it. He would have stayed if he knew marathon was gonna be a success because he would have made more money. The game is dead on arrival imo. Not quite concord, but bungie is definitely not breaking even.",
    "A lot of people don't know that Arc Raiders had a closed play test back in 2023. I played during that play test and there were a lot of things lacking. The main difference is that Marathon decided to allow streaming of their first play test.",
    "Marathon has improved on almost every category, and fixed every major complaint from the first public alpha. To the point people (particularly destiny players) are going to be pissed if they every found out how much the feedback was truly listened to",
    "Cross will play marathon. I’m in the tech build rn and this game is so much fun. It’s not as intense as what arc raiders looks like with AI but this game is addicting. I’m currently level 19 waiting on people to level up to play new map",
    "Personally for myself, Hunt Showdown has held such a high standard in the Extraction shooter scene (especially on console), that I saw the preview of Marathon and instantly knew it was DOA, Ark looked Better from the start.",
    "I wish Marathon had a single player or co-op campaign. The original games are great experiences and it'd be cool to see a modern marathon campaign with the same esoteric and mindbending writing, lore, and level design. I'm not entirely opposed to extraction shooter Marathon, but I still think that having a good campaign is much, much more valuable to a game these days.",
    "\"We were going to play both regardless.\" I really doubt this. One of the biggest complaints about Marathon before and during the alpha was that it was an extraction shooter, and everyone was saying they didn't want that. I doubt many people were saying \"I hate extraction shooters... except for that one that I didn't even know existed until a week after marathon blew its alpha.\" The idea that the community was planning on giving Arc Raiders a shot previously is ridiculous. Most of them didn't even know the game existed, and were loudly against extraction shooters. Same with most streamers.",
    "Marathon HEAVILY improved. Having more fun playing marathon rn than i did arc raiders last week personally.",
    "What I can't believe is how a whole ass company like Bungie (who is in the business of making money) has been hearing feedback about how bad it's customers or should I say player base, want a D3 and how easy it would be to sell and make money off of it. But they decide \"Nope\" let's make an extraction shooter. It's like me owning a burger restaurant, and my customers asking me if I could throw an extra Patty and some more veggies in the burger and I'm like. Nah. Here's a hot dog. And I get it, they tried to jump on the extraction shooter bandwagon hoping it would be successful. But again from a business point of view why not secure D3 first? Make money off of that then see if people are interested in the extraction shooter. Idk man....IDK",
    "I tried the new tech test for marathon at my buddies house and I really like Marathons lore and world building and I think they def can cook something but it is an uphill battle.",
    "7:00 that's what happens when you keep burning player good-will to try and turn \"trust, then profit\"",
    "Just played my first game ever on Marathon’s closed test pleaseee don’t tell me we lost Destiny 3 to this. It’s way better than I’d heard, but man … They killed my baby for THIS?",
    "All extremely valid points, love the video BTW, ARC is gunna be amazing I feel. Laterz.",
    "Marathon doesn't excite me at all. We are getting much more unique extra time shooters coming. Arc Raiders is very exciting and Embark is a good studio. SCP / S.T.A.L.K.E.R style extra tion shooter Beautiful Light is next year and Hunger which is Hunt with more of a melee focused and set in French 1815 period.",
    "Excellent video by the way...from the talking points, to the editing, to the buildup at the end :) But seriously - good points and I think we all hope the same.",
    "I didn't know about Arc Raiders until I saw the Marathon trailer, and watched Marathon reviews. A lot of reviewers were comparing the two games and so I got into Arc Raiders then I got so hooked on Arc Raiders.",
    "i’ve been playing every marathon playtest and i’ve gone from being very underwhelmed to being quite impressed. I think marathon is in a lot better state right now than most people think",
    "It baffles me that it’s soooooo simple to research your genre and target audience/community, and build the game around that feedback. Then BOOM people love it. WHAT A SURPRISE! But so many developers just shoot themselves in the foot nowadays. I’m not saying it’s simple to develop a game, but these are well budgeted studios who have people that know how to develop games. They just always make bad decisions for what they choose to make.",
    "I'll say this. I absolutely loved the ARG Puzzle marketing idea Marathon did. And I do think it created a hype around it but considering what all occurred and especially how the official responses were, created a void of wanting a extraction shooter which got filled with ARC Raiders. I do believe it did help ARC Raiders catch even more traction. which it absolutely would have without but a certain extra push did occur. I think Bungie could have done a much better job on how to handle the incidents. But I also agree with you here that it is probably for the better that Marathon now got pushed back to inevitably get more polish, more focus and maybe even learn something from what people love so much about ARC Raiders. I'm not gonna keep a grudge against Bungie here, I'm sure the assets being stolen really comes down to a handful of people rather than the whole company. Personally I do wish they can turn it around and I hope the competition it has now clearly with ARC Raiders helps them get back on track on fulfilling what gamers are asking for.",
    "What I like most about Arc Raiders is it's an enjoyable single player gameplay, Marthon from what I hear you have to squad up period. If you're friends aren't on and you just wanna play solo for a change it's just refreshing to have that feel like a good experience.",
    "Current Marathon Tech Test is a big improvement from before...or so I've heard",
    "I'm heavily enjoying Marathon rn ngl. I also heavily enjoyed Arc Raiders. I've been in 4 game tests between the two. Both are good games.",
