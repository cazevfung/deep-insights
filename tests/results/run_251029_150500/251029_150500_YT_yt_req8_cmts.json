    "Mr. Fruit and being surprised about dying immediately after ignoring a popup telling him he's going to die: name a more classic combo.",
    "29:40 Picks up a pack of cigs, gets a mission to deliver cigs 5 seconds later. Doesnt deliver cigs️",
    "I've played the demo this game is such a vibe. Hide behind the sand bags next time when in a fight and also right click on a gun you don't want to empty the bullets.",
    "Dude I love this game. Way too many hours in this already, hope you enjoyed it",
    "The puns could never ducking stop. Absolutley love the variety and that Fruit will just post one video of a game just to share something unique. That's why he's the King",
    "More of this please!! Def did not get to see enough of this game!",
    "The first mission is to feed a duck... a duck egg? This is feeling unnecessarily dark.",
    "Mr. Fruit! I bought your Cherry Limeade and Fruit shaker! I love it! Thank you for being the light in today's darkness.",
    "Extracting whenever you want to instead of being held to a time frame is one of the things that gives this game its charm.",
    "Definitely need another video! Love the style and gameplay. Perfect for a Mr Fruit series!",
    "SULFUR - check Trash of the Titans - check Die in the Dungeon - check Escape from Duckov - added to the list",
    "14:35 you bringing up can I metal gear was amazing I would love if you play MGS3 delta also have you played any of the metal gear solids? If you haven’t I would love to see a play through whenever you can even if it’s 5 years down the line as long as it’s on the list it will be fun to watch. Also the game looks like it would be so much fun if it was multiplayer.",
    "Because this game is amazing because you play as a duck, not just any duck a tactical duck",
    "Mr fruit having the redemption arc, didn't like extraction shooters and is about to go HARD in on them in 2 days, the CAHNTENT about to go hard.",
    "A rocket that early is nuts. It took me until like 22 hours to get an actual rocket drop",
    "Honestly, so true with the protein cookie. There isn't much tasty protein-esque food like cookies or yoghurt. Just have to accept the gains one way though",
    "Mr fruit I think void crew is a game that would interest you. It is a roguelite in space where you and your crew up to 6 players do different objectives to advance til the boss fight. I know you can have issues getting a crew for games like this. If you want I could help get you a crew.",
    "Make it a series until you at least beat the first boss! Would love to see that",
    "Right at lunch time my man! Hope you and the fam are doing well!",
    "Love how he missed the part where it says remove for blockades on either shortcut or sewer entrance towards the end of video.",
    "been having so much fun with this one last week now, great game, nowhere near thorough it....",
    "I bet the stuck manhole cover is the reason there's a crowbar-making mission. Just guessin'",
    "The number of people that immediately paused this video and googled...\"Do ducks hatch from eggs?\" would blow our collective minds. Yes I am one of those",
    "This was a fun low stakes shooter, would be cool to see more but know Ark Raiders is coming out lol"
