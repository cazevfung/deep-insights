    "Play ARC Raiders, launching on October 30th on Playstation, PC, & Xbox X/S https://sbx.gg/arcraiders-riloe Thank you to Embark Studios for Sponsoring this video",
    "I think the only problem I'm seeing is honestly that the players in these kinds of closed tests and previews tend to be a lot more sociable than the general playerbase",
    "Been waiting for this one. I had Riloe on my list of \"content creators I watch\" in the arc raiders stress test survey. Dude makes the some of the best videos on YouTube.",
    "The new map you were playing on looks simply breathtaking. That tunnel fight felt so cinematic with the echo. Can't wait to explore it tomorrow!",
    "0:39 I started to laugh to myself to this clip till I saw how the player reacted to being shot. That was kinda brutal.",
    "I had a fight I thought was really cool. I was just looting scrap in a hallway and a dude around the corner said he was friendly. I wanted to try to make a moment so we chatted with each other. I was on my way out, basically full and told him I had looted about half the building. I split off down stairs and get in a fight with a player. I hear shots from upstairs and he’s simultaneously in a fight with another player. We both win and reconvene. I bandage him up ( he didn’t find any) and we both decide to take the nearest extract together, it was awesome.",
    "Just saw Abney's betrayal video minutes before this, had a dark feeling the tunnel scene was coming up XD",
    "I got to play on the server slam this time (originally hadn't even known that there was going to be a one, so tyvm to Riloe for the heads-up about that in the last comment :D ), holy f, the game bangs so much, the atmosphere is so good. Also the fact i met so many friendly people in game was such a surprise to me. Something just really is grabbing my attention in the game, i just want to love it, idk i can't explain it quite well enough.",
    "I just wanted to thank you for showing me this game in the video about sound design. Since then, I haven't been able to stop watching content about ARC Raiders.",
    "Arc raiders is by definition, and in practice, an extraction shooter. Hope that helps!",
    "I’m already hyped but you just reminded me I’m more hyped than I knew I was",
    "This game just does so many things so dang well, man. The experience all falls into place so beautifully. IT’S SO GOOD! Another absolute banger of a video, Riloe!",
    "I love how you added Halo music in the background! When I think about a fun and yet atmospheric adventure game I think about Halo. I love Halo and its enemy AI. And its rich universe. Arc gave me that attraction.",
    "Riloe sponsored by embark? win win man, they couldn't have made a better choice. some of the best video game content on YT.",
    "This game feels so great, because every round feels makes you approach a map you already know, in a new way every time. Everything you do feels dangerous yet, rewarding. It feels like a piece of art, because every time you take a look at it. Something new how dumb it may be catches your eyes or ears.",
    "Oh I was just rewatching some of your videos yesterday, what a blessing to get another just before ARC drops",
    "1:53 literally just watched macro's perspective of this it all makes sense now",
    "dude that last long, drawn out fight you showed toward the end was crazy, i love how scrappy the team fights are",
    "Yet ONCE AGAIN, Riloe delivering on voicing his feelings in a way that I only wish that I could. Fkn FANTASTIC!",
    "great video my guy, and a wonderful sneak peak of the Blue Gate map! Embark has been cooking!",
    "6:18 - Those are my nades. The evil emperor voice in my brain decided we would betray, and I listened. The chaos we created was overwhelming; groups continuing to fight each other long after Abney and I had been defeated. In a way, I think this event highlights your point here even better. Great video and GGs Riloe!",
    "Listening to 'Third Coming of Time' in Esperanza while it's raining in the background as you gear up for a solo run is just Chefs kiss",
    "What a video! Captures the beauty, the intensity, the chaos and camaraderie. Great editing and voice over. Tomorrow’s launch is gonna be a blast",
    "This game elicits the most PEAK commentary out of everyone who talks about",
    "I think the best thing a new video game can do nowadays is, that you perform an action in it, and then you say to yourself \"What!? I can do that?\". It's this exact thing why Helldivers 2 and The Finals clicked so well with me when they came out.",
    "I need that rice hat outfit, I dont want it, I NEED IT.",
    "Just finished the video and this is a no question sub and follow because you really knocked it out of the park here. The writing, the ambiance, everything. Excellent video man! I look forward to seeing more of what you do in the future!",
    "Congrats on the sponsor by Embark, this is awesome. I've never been so hyped and excited about a new game coming out.",
    "I wish I'd found friendlies during the server slam. In OCE nobody wanted to be chill, just ambushes and rat play constantly.",
    "GOSH Riloe the writing for these videos is like a crisp, cold glass of pomegranate juice",
    "Such a good video. Everyone unsure about buying arc raiders needs to watch this"
