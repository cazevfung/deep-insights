    "If incursion ever adds the ability to pause I'm buying it immediately. My biggest hang up as a gamer dad is that interruptions are to be expected and sometimes you don't have time to find a bush, closet or small empty room to hide in while in a raid. It's the main reason I don't do pvp games. I'm just an AFK loot drop in these streets.",
    "1- Incrusion 2- arena breakout 3- greyzone warfare 4- hunt showdown 5- tarkov pve",
    "“Chill” is an interesting word to choose for Hunt: Showdown. I’ve never been closer to a heart attack in a video game than some of the firefights in hunt.",
    "Tacti, teach me how to play Hunt casually mate, i don't know how you put casual and Hunt in the one sentence",
    "You can also save a ton of money and make it even more Dad-Casual by just buying the base game of Escape from Tarkov and installing SPT (Single Player Tarkov). You can mod this to make it as challenging or casual as you want. There's literally a mod called Dad Mode. A HUGE endorsement to Incursion Red River and Gray Zone, they are amazing games.",
    "Not an extraction shooter, but STALKER GAMMA is single player, extremely customizable, runs on cheap hardware with it's DX8/DX9 patch, super well made, and free to play. Only downside is it's over 100gb.",
    "I would like to add Zero Sievert to the bunch. You can make it as hard or as casual as you want. It's pixelated and from above. But it's really great. Check it out!",
    "Arma Reforger while not an extraction shooter is really fitting. Just find a chill community vanilla server and drive a logistics truck once a week. Love it.",
    "Helldivers 2 is my go-to for an hour here and an hour there.",
    "3:50 Me after hearing that as an Arena Breakout mobile player: uhhh wasn't this vid about chill games etc?",
    "im a dad, i have about 40 hours in incursion red river, the game is great i can just pop in for a raid do my thing and not have to worry about other people for a little bit.",
    "I have 3k hours on Tarkov. Man there’s something about this game. Like since I played it for the first time in 2021, every other games feels a little boring. There’s an ambiance that no other game can reproduce. So yeah, I’m a chad dad haha!!",
    "DMZ made me realize I like extraction shooters..so now I have to test them all out.",
    "Check out \"The Forever Winter.\" It's a great PVE post apocalyptic extraction shooter. Besides Hunt, it has the best vibe/setting I've ever experienced.",
    "I can't get into the supernatural elements of hunt. Now, if it was a western style bounty hunter with just hunting people and thwir gangs while having to compete with other bounty hunters, I'd love that",
    "Coop PVE tarkov is a real vibe. 1500 hours of pvp and I get more enjoyment showing my friends around in PVE.",
    "The struggle is real lol. I love Arma Reforger, but time is not on my side considering wife, kids, and career. Although, I cannot wait until my son is old enough to play Arma with me. That will be cool",
    "Tarkov PVE is goated. It's not perfect, but it's easily my favorite game of all time.",
    "As a dad, I approve of this video. Great suggestions for us older guys. Thanks!",
    "Jumped into incursions with a few buddies last night love the new update. As a dad I only got to do one raid but had a blast",
    "One game I think you should try tacti, is called witchfire and it's more of a fantasy RPG but it does have fun extraction type elements and the gun play is so amazing. It's on par with destiny 2",
    "Forever winter is also an option full pve and go solo or in groups and is ment as a slower game play where you look to avoid fights rather than start them.",
    "As a dad with 1200 hours in tarkov , tarkov is the tarkov for me",
    "I recently decided to try Stalker GAMMA and I know it's not exactly an extraction shooter.. but man, this game is good, I'm super invested playing, learning, watching guides.. and it's FREE! 10/10 would recommend",
    "Tarkov PVE is pricey but you could literally put a 1000 hours into it there’s that much to do and it’s that good of a game. I like all the other games on this list I’ve spent time playing them but as a busy dad nothing comes close to Tarkov’s PVE experience for me.",
    "IRR can actually be VERY hard if you set the reaction time and detection range of the AI at really crissspy levels",
    "We need the AI from TimeSpliters 3 on ps2 awesome AI it even had different attitudes for the AI.",
    "Dad of a few kids here. Your opinions pretty much reflect my own. You performed a great analysis of them all. I don’t have a ton of time but Tarkov tops my list for sure despite the gigachads I usually encounter lol. GZW is getting quite fun however and you can find PvP quickly now if you have played it for over 30 hours and know where to find it. I can jump in and hunt down a player, ambush them, sell or store their stuff and get back to real life in 30 min or less! Great for a quick break or a few hours in the evening. Group vs group PvP centered around Combat Outposts is also a ton of fun and very intense if you want that nail-bitingly intense combat. I love the room you have for broader strategic plays that is not always possible in Tarkov.. Thanks for the great content!",
    "Incursion Red River looks perfect for me - wish they had controller support",
    "Love your videos Tacti. As someone who just started their own channel for gaming recently , your videos are something I enjoy doing \"research\" on. Keep it up !",
    "I play GZW in PVE only and it’s a blast everyone I run into wither in my faction or not is really helpful and they are making more optimization updates and improvements I have been playing GZW since Jan 2025 and have over 100 hours I recommend it",
    "Call of Duty DMZ was my jam, but now it's unsupported and chock full of hackers and sweats.",
    "1:08 the only suggestion I could make to this whole list escape from tarkov PvE because you can play it at your own pace and learn the game at your own pace",
    "Delta Force is perfect for dads. You can build your stash by crafting in the black site and make money by selling those goods. You can even do inventory management in the mobile version, or even play the mobile version because it has cross progression",
    "Man, what issues are you have with running Gray Zone? It’s a masterpiece. The openness allows you to play in so many different ways."
