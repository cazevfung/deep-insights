Maybe we're just not there yet. I don't like the aimbot for everybody. I cannot lie. New contract. Who this? Yeah, they need to get rid of aim magnetism. I think it's I think I think PC players would rather not have it and deal with controllers a beaming you than having everybody having it. I'm turning it off. Like I I don't want to use it. It's just it just feels so, you know, like I I can't can't use it. I mean, I like it. It's kind of I feel like I'm a I'm a I'm a cheater. I feel like I can't miss which is kind of cool.

Hold on. What are these mats, bro? I don't know what I'm reading. So, okay. So, okay. So, so what I'm understanding about the loot icons is the little loot bags, those are just quite simply you just sell them. The little uh X's are materials, so you could use them for crafts. And then the I guess the white symbols like the pluses and stuff, those are all usables. So X is for crafts and quests and loot bags is just raw cash to sell to people. I understand it now. What the Someone just Someone's sniping me. Oh, it's AI. We're good. Bro, this aimbot's so weird. It's so weird. Unless I Yeah, I turned it off. That ass. I can't lie. I didn't even move my mouse to trace that robot. Oh, wait. What's cool is my mod says upon Xfill, this item's value will be increased. So, as long as I keep leaving with this implant, it just keeps stacking money. That's cool as My god, that's so much damage. All right, we out for Yeah, let's leave. Let's leave. How do we leave? What's What is this? Why is there something red? What is that? Wait, there's only one Xfill on the map. Crate on the roof, I think. There's only one X. Hold on. There's a How do we get on the roof? There's a crate on the roof. Pop my thought. Oh, there is. You see it? There's a crate right here. Yeah, he's right. I don't know how we get on the roof, but it landed on. I just double jump that [ __ ] Yeah, we're we're up. We're up. Wait, this isn't a crate, bro. Okay. I don't know. It looked like a drop. 5 minutes until Wait, there's loot up here, DJ. Oh, [ __ ] Oh, there's a lot of loot. There's a lot of loot. Oh my god, there's a lot of loot. Okay, he was Oh my god, there's a lot of loot. There's a big backpack here if anyone wants it. Energy amp. I can use it, I guess. Wait, big backpack. No, it's it's not. There's med bags, ammo bag. It's a It was a loot bag. Okay, you were right that there is a cash up here. I mean, accidentally. I'm accidentally right. I found a drum mag. Wait, eight slot. Wait, this is way better. Gives me health as well. That's what's up. Yeah. Where's the extract? Uh, what? It's like Oh, crew extract. I see. Oh, we're next to it already. Okay, I see. How do I I think we use this, right? And then Yeah, I'm activating it. I get like a boost when we Xville. I get a boost to all my stats around Xville. Ready or not, I'm going to be honest. I got money. Yeah, I got some [ __ ] bank on me. Three minutes. Oh, wait. Three minutes of the raid. How do we leave? I think you hit me. We just sit here. No. Yeah, probably. Honestly, just count down. Uh, can you It says attach though. How do we I don't know. Is it 3 minutes on the raid or 3 minutes? Oh, there's only two and a half minutes on the raid. If this doesn't work. This isn't an extract, is it? It is. It is. It says Oh, there you go. Xville. Oh, it is. Okay. Yeah, you brought it down, so you have to activate it, I guess. I didn't touch anything. I literally didn't need a single button, does it? Hell yeah, you put it down. Weird. I guess it's weird there's not like a countdown like that tells you when you're able to. There's only a countdown when you're able to Xville. Dude, how did those other guys you fought not extract? Probably cuz they were We fought them off before like they just walked off, I guess. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah, they walked off cuz How much money you guys make? Uh, wait. Shared by TJ. What the is this? You see that? 2,000. What is that shared by? What is this shared by at the bottom? Maybe you picked up some of my loot. I didn't have any of those. I didn't have those items. That's weird. I don't know what that means. Doesn't even tell you. Oh, it auto sells. Oh, that's cool as the valuables just auto sell. Sell everything. Oh, wait. TJ, did you also get the bloom flower and the synchronizer? Cuz I have it in my inventory. Maybe some stuff is like like we team Maybe we got it together as a team because I Did you get that too? Um Justin? Yeah, I did. You have the synchronizer and the bloom? Yeah. Wait, that's cool. So, it's like a shared loot thing. Items are some items are shared. That's cool. I like that a lot, actually. I like the stat system. Yeah, I like the build system, the cores, the implants, uh, shields, like that stuff's all cool. Um, what I don't love is like it seems pretty bare bones when you're in the menu, like in the sense of Yeah. like do is am I just buying from the black market? That's it. This is all I have. My access is just is is just I think you need to do quests to unlock factions and then when you unlock factions you get like you get their their you get their stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Okay. I would like to be able to do more contracts than one at a time. I feel like call me crazy, okay? But I feel like in a game like this, you can do missions slowly at your own pace, but if your pace is faster than other people, you should be able to like accept so much and knowledge will get you further faster.",
