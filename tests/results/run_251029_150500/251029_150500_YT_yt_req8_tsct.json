  "content": "Hiy ho everyone. My name is Mr. Fruit and welcome to Escape from Duckov. This game that's taken over. That's definitely not just a single player spoof of Escape from Tarov if it were top down and based around ducks. Now I'm newly hatched and just began my chicken. Nope, not a chicken. A duck. Do ducks. They come from eggs, right? Yes, ducks hatch from eggs. Everyone knows that. Just like everybody knows that this is my hideout, which I have barely upgraded because again, I've pretty much just like hopped on, did the tutorial, and I was like, \"All right, yeah, we're going to we're going to check this out because it's been taken over China by storm. China's been popping off.\" We'll worry about the hideout and all those specifics later. For now, we're hopping into Duck before we have to escape. Since this is a single player extraction shooter, well, there's a map and there'll be enemies. They're all AI. So, I can choose to go to this extraction point if I'm closer. But if I'm ever closer to my bunker entrance, I can just hop back in. Extracted all my goods. Bada bing, bada boom. Now, it's going to tell me to go ahead and loot this. Oh, it's a donation box. Okay. So, I assume every time I come out here, in case I don't have firearms on me or something, well, they'll Hey, stupid. You dumb duck. Grab this. And I'm like, whoa, what's with the quacking, bro? No need for that. So that also means we have missions. So currently actually I found some meatthead totally not like me who was working out and said he needs some protein. So I need to find this muscular duck who is quite muscular and makes me feel a little uncomfortable and give him a duck egg and I'll get rewards just like I can find another letter, go to this kill these hunters, build certain workbenches in my hideout, blah blah blah. So there's progression. There's also a skill tree somewhere. I don't know if I can see it here. I don't think I can. But that's B. Who? Those are the basics. Just like, hold up. This duck thinks he's just the quackiest. Where? Where'd go? Oh, wait. Wait. We got multiple tangos and a shotgun. Wait, I've never fought a shotgun. Okay, well, if we keep him at range. All right. Now, wait, wait, wait, whoa. Ow. Oh, god. Hold on. Wait for him to fire. Ow. Point blank. Okay, so we took a little bit of damage. And I made this guy into a Thanksgiving turkey. Is Could that be roasted duck? Not that I've ever had it. Before we get further, I want to thank this video sponsor, Rocket Money. Now, it's always been a dream of mine to buy a castle.

Thank you to Rocket Money for sponsoring today's video. Just like an extraction shooter, it takes a little while to uh loot their inventory and then you look, oh my gosh, dude had one cash. I don't have that's my first cash, so we're killing it. fragments, a feather to remember our fallen enemies. Instead of a skull, you know, we just pluck their feathers. Those are the trophies. We keep one of their guns, which I can take back and just sell, more or less, cuz these little pistols aren't exactly the best. But if this Can I get this guy's a shotgun? Oh, you know I can, brother. All right. Well, we're throwing that into the secondary. Also seems like it has a couple of mod slots. I don't have any of that stuff. My first couple of buckshells. Wee. Oh, we're doing it now. P. And it's exactly what you would think it is, but charming. And uh it's taken over in China. It's Chinese developed. So perhaps that's why. I don't know why I just went into my settings to try and heal myself. How about I pop an aspirin before we go ahead and extract? Cuz I'm nearly Oh, full on stuff. I got to reload. Hold on. Oh, nice roll. Yo, shoot the tree, stupid. There's a freaking Okay. Okay. The accuracy. The accuracy. I got to reload. I got to reload. Ah, okay. The the rolling resets my reload, which is understandable, my immersion. Get some more aspirin, some more bullets. Our prison wallet AO is instead our little friend here. I don't actually know his name, but it's our duck dog. Or is it a dog colored like a duck? I thought it quacked, but the more I'm looking at it, the more you definitely look like a dog. Was it my dog? Wait, I can actually lift. Oh, maybe maybe the meatthead wants this. If you want some Hold up. I'm Wait, wait, wait. Is my shotgun reloaded? It is. Here I go. Missed. He didn't miss. Oh my god, I'm going to freaking die. Oh my god, the shotgun hurts. Okay. Okay. You know, maybe we stay at range. Maybe we stay range. I didn't look at what weapon he was using. I thought at first maybe it was a pistol, so the shock, but no. Yep. Rolling into the shotgun was a play. Wait, this guy had 52 cash. I went from 0 to one to 53. Now, that's what we call come up, folks. So, we're going to hop in here. This is where I found it. Now, I must warn you, viewer discretion is advised. Some might be unsettled by what they're about to to watch. You might be like, \"Mr., what are you talking about?\" You'll understand. Um, okay, maybe not. Last time I talked to him, it zoomed in. Let's just say his pecs and abs are so defined, they're unsettling. We'll put him that way. So, protein alone just isn't enough. Carbs are important, too. Go fetch me a cookie. Run. All right, man. But see, right now, we're at the early stage of the game where it's easy to make progress. Get some extractions. My load out is full. I actually appear to be completely dehydrated. I think I'm dying or something from that. Uh, I'm not sure. Unfortunately, I don't have anything to drink on me. So, I do think there is a meal box around. Oh, right there. Hold on. Cuz yes, there are survival elements. You can see I have stamina. Oh, fudge. You got be I'm I'm eating some candy. That looked like mayo. But ow ow. How'd you hit? Son of a gun. You can hit head shot, but you got to aim carefully. I I think I'm hearing footsteps, which is unfortunate cuz I got to get out. Are they They're not spawn camping my bunker, are they? Nah, they would never. The cowards. They know not to come near here. So, yeah, we're early enough in the game where there's just quests progression. We're working on our hideout, which is why I wanted to start here, too, cuz we're just getting a feel for the game. You guys get to see this as well. And if you guys end up liking it too, it feels like I'm going to be playing this. So, maybe next video after I've played a bit, we kind of like hop into the future and see how everything's looking. But so let's go over our hideout here, right? So first off, you start. I assume if you use an extraction point that's not the bunker or you die, you'll respawn in your room. You can sleep to pass the time cuz currently it's like 1:24 in the day. If it's night time, it's darker, harder to see, and the game has told me evidently it enemies will be harder and whatnot. I haven't gone out at night time. You're a dog. But oh my god, what the [ __ ] We uh we could change the track if we wanted to. We could customize our face. We could also change the difficulty if we wanted. And if we head on over here, we have our sensei duck. I don't actually know what his name is, but he's the one that's given us majority of our quests. We have Amazon delivery locker for if we get rewards from quests. He gives us stuff, I don't know, somewhere else. Our warehouse, aka our storage, our stash. This is where we'll put all of our excess goods that we're not carrying into each raid. I'll probably keep the aspirins. I don't need the homemade candy right now or the wood or really majority of what we got in our inventory for all that right there. If we're going to keep the shotgun, we'll need both things of ammo. I don't need uh that large stack of pistols or uh bullet ammo for my pistol because if there is a max, I don't want to hit it. As far as my equipment, I have a police baton. I just got this from the tutorial. as well as this white lab coat, which offers minimal body armor. Gives me two more backpack slots, though. I got a cosmetic pouch, which gives me more weight capacity and more backpack capacity. I've got shades because why not? And I just now realized actually they just reduce my visual range. Okay, so I'm just going to take I'm just going to take those off. They must have some benefit somehow. Or maybe, yeah, it's just a flex. Hard to say. We can throw the shotgun back in the stash. This is all the random assorted goods we have. There's also a store. So, this is where we could sell our excess stuff. So, we go to the warehouse. If I wanted to trade a feather, I'd get 500 uh bucks. Apparently, we could get a helmet for some head armor. I mean, how much money do I have? 2,200. Okay. Not that much. Not that much. Do we by chance have a cookie in here? Cuz I could just buy that and deliver that. There's recipes for dynamite and dynamite clusters. There's even AKs. Holy. But those are um yeah, those are expensive. Safety first, though. I I am going to buy the steel helmet, you know. Got to wear protection. There you go, buddy. Oh, we're all set. Now, to advance processing, which unlocks the ability to craft certain items, and it would appear I have enough nuts and bolts. Sheesh. So, if we research it, I' I've never researched or upgraded anything. So, if we activate it, objective completed. We could now in this uh branching path get fixed stationation locks the ability to repair weapons and equipment or disassemble locks the ability to disassemble items. So come over here. We completed the quest. So we're going to get some XP, some currency, and some weapon parts. And he might have he does a new mission for us. With the upgraded workbench, you can make some pretty good stuff. Try crafting a glick. I want to see your skills. I come over here. What would it take to craft a glick? We need three more weapon parts. There's also skill enhancements over here. This is actually the first one I guess I could have gotten. So for 150 I get four extra backpack accuracy. I don't mind if I do. Let's go and research this. This appears to be, you know, like the skill tree, which actually quite a bit. And you know, I love me a skill tree. So we activate that. And then let's see, what do we got next? For level one, max HP, bigger field of view, gun damage multiplier, recoil control. Further on, we got stuff like more backpack accuracy or uh capacity, reload speed, perception range, so on so forth. Some head armor. Keep yourself safe out there, people. KY, never forget. Okay. And then, oh, talents. What is this? So, I'm currently your average duck. I mean, my mom always said I was above average, you know, I was special, but fine. So, how will we get survivor? Complete quest to unlock storm resistance. Uh, so the survivor reporter, Berserker, and Marksman. Okay. I mean, I don't mind being an average duck. We got to get back out there, folks. I didn't actually look. It's 552. Okay. So, we might end up finding ourselves uh outside at night, which you know what? It's a challenge. Let's look at some of these quests cuz he'll might tell us. So, like received a letter from a friend, which I left in the red tent on Small Hill. Well, uh, this is Small Hill. I haven't been there, but I'm going to assume there's probably a red tent there. So, let's head that way. The donation box always giving me a pistol and some ammo. So, why the heck not? And already some enemies a foot. And it's Yeah, immediately 6:00. All right. Sun's already going down. Sun's getting real low. Big guy toolbox. This is all stuff that's probably going to be helpful for construction, right? And before I go, like I said, the the this map, I'm not sure how many maps there are, how any of that works, but this map um spawns or like these resource nodes more or less seem to be static. So, I know like at the start of a journey, okay, well, I know I can stop by here and always end up grabbing some food that I might need for the mission. Mission complete. Now, I don't think Can I pin on the map? I don't believe I can. All right, so we just got to keep going up this way. See if we can make it there. Is there I don't know if I need the small stones. Although says I I can throw them for a distraction, I guess, as any good self-respecting video game will allow you to do. Need to make sure I reload, too, cuz doesn't do that automatically. And I quite often get caught with my pants down. It's It's something up. No, it's a bad doggy. Oh, why did you Why did you have to run? Oh, I don't even get any loot. Uh, who wants some empty loot? What? I get like some meat to cook or something, man. Got to eat. What? Sorry. Duck's got to eat. Oh, what the heck? Get down. I see you. You sussy baka. Get turned on. And Oh, bro. Had an AK74. Brother, do you know how much money that is? Oh my god. I don't mind if I do. I'll put that over my P. Oh my goodness. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. What a what a generous donation. Thank you. Box. I can't. I was going to say, can I metal metal gear? I I think I can snake it. Ready? Hold on. Let's see. Oh, come on. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, it's peak. Even the gun poking out. I'm afraid it's peak. Okay, that's that's incredible. How do I How do I stop the Oh, no. Oh, I thought it could stop the Okay, unfortunately it appears once I use it, I can't unuse it. I thought I could like, you know, use it, put it away, use it for the No. So, we just got to make the most of this disguise while I can. Aka, we'll just bum rush for the small tent. I also have to be cautious and wary of my stamina so we don't get caught out. But again, I'm just a walking cardboard box. What are they going to do? Who is that? What the fudge? Who's Are they shooting me? What was this? A data box? A recipe for a crowbar? A medical box. That Okay. Aspirin. Don't mind if I do. What do we got over here? A letter from an old friend. What do you know? A box. I'm a box. Oh, I'm a cardboard box. Painkiller. Syringes. Okay, this all seems pretty good. Water from an old friend. I'm going to put that in the old prison wall since it's, you know, a uh quest item. Uh, I'm going to pop an aspirin. Uh, but now I'm thirstier. I'm I will eat a dumpling. Get some of my energy back. Need to find some awa, however. Oh, would you leave that bottled water? Well, thanks. Ask and ye shall receive, says Duck. And last but not least, can I grab the penos? You betcha. And who might this be? Oh, it's a traitor. Whoa. The STG, a stockless compact design with low recoil and an integrated optical site. Okay. A Mosen classic sniper rifle. A suppressor. Hey yo, so that reduces bullet speed and effective range, but very silent. I want all of these. However, I know I can't afford them. You're not selling cookies by chance, are you? No, I don't think so. Yeah, these are all kind of What the are you trying to rob me? I'm tempted to buy them, but plastic barrel catches goes for a bunch of money, which mean makes me think that maybe I should How about I sell all those small stones? Go for it. Oh, but then I have to hold on to the cash. Well, that makes sense. You know, I got to extracted the cash, too. Let me grab this toolbox. The nail. Uh, my disguise only lasted 40 more seconds. Oh crap. There's something here. What are my other quests perhaps? Um, the kill. So, okay. I don't know where to find those guys. Uh, anything else? He techsavvy friend. He stashed gear in a yellow bus on the ground zero highway. Ground zero. Is this the highway? Yellow bus. Oh, kind of looks like a yellow bus to me, chief. All right. Well, I think we just got to head back anyway. Although, I'm trying to figure out who is shooting me. Also, what is this? Oh, wow. What is that? I'm looking at the road camp. Okay. Oh, and I lost my disguise. Oh, crap. Ground zero watch log. I've been watching for a few days. The road camp folks seem off. Their leader glows with fire. Doesn't look like someone you want to mess with unless you're fully prepared. Stay away from them. Okay. Well, I guess that's uh the final boss, so to speak. All right. Come on, buddy. They didn't give you a n a name, so I'm going to call you um your dog, but Oh my god. What the [ __ ] Um Okay. So, I guess that's what they mean by it's not safe at not Excuse me. All right. Well, now see, can I get my loot back? Is that how this work? Oh, no. At least I kept the letter for the quest. But I had the AK and and my shotgun and my my helmet and my B. Oh, I'm poor again. There's also a storm that arrives in 88 minutes. I wonder if perhaps the maps change daily, but I don't I don't think so. So much brighter on. Okay. Well, let's grab uh the small donation and then Okay. Oh, lost items. Okay. Wait a second, folks. So, you're telling me there's a chance? Let's grab some food real quick. Wait, that that fire is still warm. Who's here? I hear you waddling about the a fudge. Ah, I don't have my my gun out. Oh, I'm bleeding and I don't have bandages. Fudge. This is This is going downhill, sir. Sir, do you have bandages? I'm dying. I'm dying, sir. You have a shotgun, but that's not going to do. Ah. Ah. Oh, God. I need to get home. I This is awkward. Normally, you would use a bandage to stop the bleeding. Wait. Wait. But what if Okay. Okay. Okay. The bleeding stopped. I was just thinking what if I go in and then leave if like I only have one raid essentially to grab my my mats or my my drop. I don't know. That's kind of what I'm thinking, right? So, if I were to escape and then come back, they might be gone and we can't have that. I I need my gear back, which also means I need to not get hit anymore. Not that I was trying. At least I got it. Oh, shotgun back. Who's this? Ow. Oh, fudge. What do you want? I need a way for him to shoot. Okay, we are we are living on a prayer here. Uh yeah, and I don't Okay, if I can get to my if I can get to my items, I'll have aspirins and whatnot, but no bueno. No bueno. I don't think I can sneak so many. He has an AK. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think I got to go around. Oh, I have to build the bridge. Interesting. A hiding spot. Oh, I need a shovel. Okay, get my gear back. Yes. Uh, give me that. Put that on. Let's eat this potato. Potato. Potato. And just like that, we are so back, baby. It's like we never left. Now I Now I just need to escape. Escape from Duck. If I could find one more plank though, I could build this bridge. Although, is it a one time thing? I don't know. We're going to find out. I'm going to build it now. And then I'll come back tomorrow. All right. Now, we waddle home. Go, go, go. I want to go home. Speaking of which, near home there is this bubble thing. I can't figure out what it is, but by my guess, I need some sort of an explosive cuz that's the only way in. Like there's that little crate, but like I can't jump or anything. But anywh who, we're back safely. Oh, never worried, never doubted. Thank the Lord. I was I was going to be devastated. I don't know if I would have ever emotionally recovered from that. Now, let's go ahead and bank all this stuff. But come over here real quick and we blueprint research. We should be able to grab the crowbar recipe. All right. I don't know if that's just a melee weapon or we need that to open up things. When swung, it can pierce through almost any armor. Makes perfect sense in physics. All right. Says bound equipment cannot be dropped while equipped. Wonder if that maybe they're also cuz currently it is only single player. I think there might be like a mod people are making or something for multiplayer, but it's not quite there yet. Uh we can make some shotgun shells cuz I guess what? We have rusty bullets, but I wonder what the difference like a standard bullet armor penetration level is minus one and less armor break. Oh, and perhaps shooting it wears your weapon faster. It does. Do I want to make some of these? Do we get anything to be able to build? No. Still looking for We need a circuit board, Eolam MD, a bulb, rope. Rope 160 and bulb 510. They They're a little expensive, but let's go ahead and make some progress, baby. Let's go ahead and make an armor shop. I got the armor. Oh, and it's real big. Oh, and we get a new armor friend to give us all the goods we need. Oh, I love that. Hey. Hi. How are you? What are you buying? What are you selling? But first, let's complete that quest. Gives us some XP and currency. To be fair, we get about the same currency back that we used to spend to craft it. So, no harm, no foul. You have a quest. Give me a quest. I ordered some new goods, but the supplier just told me they were robbed halfway. The goods were lost near the forest path by campfire tent. Head over there, mark the spot. Don't forget to bring a marker. I'll make it worth your while. If you don't have one, try the vending machine or asking. We get level three body armor and a SWAT helmet. Oh my gosh. But we need a marker. Bookkeeping orders have been piling up and I can't keep track anymore. I've already messed up several. They say it's better to write down things and memory. So, get me a good pen. Objective cement and ink pen and a notebook. We do have a notebook. And if we wanted to trade a school bag for 338 gives me five more weight and four more capacity than my current backpack, it's 338 bucks. What do headphones do? Sound localization and better hearing. Allows you to detect the direction of sound. That's neat. And I think I saw the marker. It's 730. Well, I'm going to buy it cuz completing that quest and getting that gear. Uh, definitely seems worth it. Let's go, buddy. I still got to come up with a name for you. Comment section. That's up to you. What are we going to name our duck? Dog. Dog. Duck. I think it is a dog. Hey, kind of seems like that, right? Oh, I can mark it on the map. Let's head that way. I've never gone this way. How exciting. To be fair, I haven't seen much of this map yet cuz we're we're just making incremental progress. The whole point is we're not supposed to just go out and see everything, you know. Just grab a little. Don't be too It's an extraction shooter, even if it's single player, you know. Get what you can. Don't be greedy. Get away with it. Make some progress. Grab some food. You know how it is. Still need a cookie. A protein cookie, which I've gotten some protein cookies. And you know, some people are like, \"Oh, I swear by this protein cookie or whatever. It's so good, man. They're still protein cookies and there's there's always like a weird texture or like they're too like they're oddly chewy and they still don't have quite the same taste. Like I get it. You know, they're trying. What is this around? Oh, cannot be open from the side. The heck? I think I have to go small hill all the way around. All right. All right. Yeah, I'm going to double check, but it certainly looked like on the map this is a dead or is it? Can I pick up this explosive barrel? No. Okay. So, see like this would be good to blow up that thing near the the B. Oh, fudge. Enemy has found us. I mean, I guess I found the enemy. I kind of just Wait. What am I walking into though? Whoa. An ADAR level one body armor. What the [ __ ] is going on here? cosmetic pressure sensor. Oh my Russ AR bullets, bro is freaking strapped, man. What the heck? Pop some aspen real quick. Holy. Um, okay. We have we have enough rusty bullets. Let's get rid of those. Uh, let's eat the canned tuna. That actually took hydration. Didn't see that. Okay, we we need hydration. What else? What else do I want from this? I I mean it's only two bucks. I'll take it though. All right. Well, stay frosty. What What does this do? Civilian variant of a service rifle. While less powerful, it offers stab superior stability and broader attachment c. It can have five attachments. That's the fun part, too, when you don't have anything. Every Oh, rocket. What the f? Everything you find is like, oo, piece of candy. The honey takes away. It fully fills energy, but omega reduces hydration. I'm going to get rid of this pistol. It doesn't sell for much anyway. The level one body armor is actually just better than the lab coat I'm wearing. Ooh, there's a blueprint over there. Oh, fudge. Get absolutely destroyed. He had an AK74 you and a cosmetic pouch. Oh my buddy, we are so up right now. I don't need that pistol. Take that. Hey, hey, hey. Oh my god. Wait, it's getting dark. Oh, fudge. Uh. Oh, suck. Um, loot this really quick. Uh, I I think I almost just unconsciously said really quack. I didn't mean to do that. Um. Oh, fudge. Uh, get rid of the nail. Grab this. Oh, we're we're going to die to the robots now. We're going to die to the robot. I didn't How did they get night time so fast? I'm dehydrated. Yes, I know. I know. I know. But I'm almost home. I'm almost home. Take me home. Get Get inside. Nailed it. Okay, that that snuck up on me. How it got dark so fast. But then again, I guess like even the day is going on right now. Oh, wait. No, nightfalls at 22:00. Wait, at 10:00 p.m. Oh, I thought it was like last I guess wasn't pen. Okay, so maybe we weren't that in in dire straits, but I don't regret uh running away. I think we are good to head back on out there, chief. What What are my other quests? Okay, so I know I'm doing that, but is there something else? Oh, wait. He's I thought he said cookie. He wants soda crackers. Wait a second. Soda crackers. This item is required for a quest. Oh, okay. Well, there you have it. All right. Well, now I can give that to him. I will see you boys tomorrow cuz I go sleep. All right, I I will take this generous donation just in case and head over here to immediately grab this here food. Drop the the cracker off. And then I could technically I guess since I'm already going this way, we can just go back through small hill cuz it will eventually wrap back around. Sure, I've got your protein crackers. They're not actually protein crackers, but we just tell them that they have like I just put like extra protein on the box, but the difference is negligible. Wow, thanks, man. Here's some exp and currency. Appreciate it. Now he wants red band cigarettes. Some seaggies. Nice work. Still feels like something's missing. As they say, smoking after a meal. Bring me a pack of seaggies. This is your final trial. His voice changed cuz I didn't realize. Yeah, he's a chain smoker, but I assume all this stuff is respawn. Medical box. Okay, I'll take the aspirin tool box. We got butcher knife, which I do need for my quest. Technically, I think I'm supposed to kill people for it, but I mean, hey, we found it. Pile of meds, syringe. Hey, Steis. Let's get to quacking. Fluffing my feathers. Cover me. And more food. Maybe some saggies. That would be nice. Or a dumpling. Duck egg. Can tuna and water? Carrot dumpling. Like, how does a canned tuna in water dehydrate me? You know, it kind of sounds like it would hydrate me a little, but the heck do I know? Miscellaneous box. It could have anything like a sippo, some tape, some nuts, and paper rolls. I do have redband cigarettes. When did I get those? Oh, that looks important. That's that thing that's close to us that's usually locked. What the Oh. Oh, that is entirely It's a teleport. Wait, that's huge. Okay. A fudge. Hey, chill, man. Chill. Chill. Chill. Chill. Chill. I'm going. I'm going. It was a warning shot. And you know what? I've been warned. I I'm not interested right now. I'm I'm trying to remember. At the very least, a fudge. Even if I don't end up marking the place, at the very least, if I could just open the fence so that next time Hey, hey. Who's What the fudge? Oh, bro's chasing me. Get out of here, man. Little BK, bro. Stay frosty. No dumb, stupid tool blocks. What do we got? What do we got? Wait, I need the Oh god. Oh, that's one of those crazy dudes they're talking about. Yeah, with the butcher and my bro just came running at me. They were not lying. Give me that aspirin. You know, I might I might actually be able to mark this. I might be able to do this. Oh. Oh, jeez. I'm hearing a lot of quacks, which mean we we are not alone. Okay, there we go. I have the superior range with this thing. Let's go. Grab what you can and go. I'll just drink the soda. Okay, how uh mark. Oh, let's go. I wonder if it consumes the marker and probably, right? Let's find out. Objective completed. It does does take it. Okay, good to know. Throw something in the old prison wall there. What? A safe. Oh, there's got a book. Toy fish notebook. Okay, these a cannon. They just got to sell for a lot. Right, we're good. We're good. Let's go. Let's go. We're going back home. We're going home. We're going home. Feel the world. We're going home. Right after I look over here, take a peek. See is at this real quick. UV light. Okay. Sippos. Wow. A lot of sippos cable. Okay. Wait. This stuff looks important. Extracted. This is This is just oddly fun. unsatisfying, especially with all the progression and stuff. How could I say no? First off, quest. This is the whole thing we were doing. Boom. Level three body armor and a SWAT helmet. Oh my. Boop boop boop boop. Okay, now we go equipment. SWAT helmet, head armor plus three. That's an additional one than what we currently have. And the body armor gives two additional body armor and an additional backpack capacity. A no-brainer. Now, I am curious about something. So, when I first came here, I saw these. I'm like, \"What is this?\" You go down like a sewer system. There's some exit over here, but it says manhole cover seems to be stuck. So, it might be a different map. Something about fishing, I guess, to farm town demo challenge. Okay, so I need tickets. Don't have those. But then there's this. I can offer feather. Is this like an oult ritual? I don't know. I'm I'm going to offer feathers. And we got a totem. Totem. Sturdy one largely increases carry weight. 25% extra max weight. That's pretty good. I feel so much lighter. I'm moving so fast. Holy. Until I loot stuff, of course, and then I'm going to be weighed down again by the weight of the world and my problems. Uh, okay. So, we got to turn that in. Otherwise, we could head to the highway and we just got to head shot some dudes. No, little doggy. I'm sorry. We got to give our favorite meathead his saggies. Even though I, you know, I don't support it, but thank you very much. What next? Fitness coach build a proper gym for mud at the base. Oh, he can join us. Well done. You passed my trials with flying colors. I decided I'm moving in with you. Build a gym at your place and I'll move in. Really need to get a shovel. This should be a blueprint. No. Blueprint for explosive arrow. I really got to make a bow. Bro saw me through the fence like that. Oh, [ __ ] Oh, stupid. Didn't stand a chance. Give me your crackers. Okay. But see, this is the problem about getting more loot, though, or more inventory space. I just failed immediately. Reminds me of Destiny, right? Like they give the community more stash just for people to hoard more. Okay, now breathe. Aha. Cuz I was remembering I got to kill with head shots. Ah, fudge. Aha, there's two. I don't want to go into the road camp. Fix that eventually. But first, let's go to that bus. Never miss. Whoa. Okay. Wait, what the fudge? Oh, I mean like all right, bet. But I don't have a fishing rod. Was it? Whoa, whoa, whoa, bro. Is uh very uh wishful with that shotgun range. I mean, this certainly looks like the bus pile of electronic parts. That is exactly what we're looking for. Although, I don't know how that makes this different than I guess it's just the quest specific one. I don't know. Drink a sod pop. I hate that those songs and in and demon hunter really I mean they really are just so catchy, man. Oh, and you know what? Now I'm closer to the extraction point. So, we could use that. Oh, but is dos. I don't know, but I see a blueprint. Let's go, buddy. We're close to extraction anyway. We got time in the day. It's all good. I don't have inventory space, though. Uh, brother. Oh, you need the Greyhouse key. Sussy bakers. Who saw me? What? Oh, what are they fighting? Oh, they fighting dogos. Oh, well done, doggy. Now go away. Yeah. Yeah. Duerte. They They're just terrible at killing the wild. Or maybe just like me, they're hesitant and that's why hesitation kills, but they're like, I don't want to. Don't make me a Wait, why' this guy have so much stuff? Was he even? I haven't seen a cola. It even makes you happy. Wait, it heals HP, gives you energy, gives you hydration, and happy. What the heck? Drop some bandages or something for that. That seems pretty good. Dad, see you nerds. Xville complete. Ducklings, I'm home. Time to venture into the stars and seas. Building our teleporter is step one. With it, we can instantly jump to other regions, provided you've activated their beacons first. Where where do we want to be? Pom the iron. How you doing over here? Huh? Physical training. Oh, more skill trees. Okay, so we can go for high knees to get mobility or push-ups or melee damage multiplier. How about better mobility? Oh, wait a minute. Been needing a lot of raw materials lately. Buying all the time won't cut it. Get me some UV lights. I'll start growing my own. I think I know what he's talking about. Go ahead and fix this bridge. Yeah, I guess this is a quicker way. I mean, let's let's let's peep what they got over here real quick. Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah, this AR Oh, armor's coming in clutch. And the AR is nasty with it. Oh, we're bleeding. That's right, cuz we got a bandage for a situation like this. Pop a little aspirin. Is there anything hidden back here? They don't want me back here. There is remove. What? What is this? Oh, I uncovered the manhole. So, it's just a different way to enter the map now. Oh, stupid. Oh, here we go. Yes, that was a head shot. But I do know that I'll kill anyone here. And oh, but we get to dig up our first mound. You a duck. Never forget. Toilet cleaner. I need this. I don't remember why, but obvious probably for another crafting station or whatever. And another blueprint for an MD40. Another homemade shotgun, except this one is like flawless durability. A VP13. So semi-auto civilian rifle based on the AK-47. Now we dig this. I wonder if maybe the shovel has durability. Or maybe not. What the earthworms and thread? Okay, I'm Yeah, we got to go home. Uhoh. Yeah, I'm a little over encumbered. So now I waddle over here. Oh, probably doesn't help too that I'm dehydrated, but I don't have anything. Wait, what? I'm about to get jumped at my own house. The heck is this? Oh jeez, that's a yes. The What the fudge? The audacity is What the fudge? Why you all rolling up on me? I'm overweight. I'm dehydrated. I'm about to be starving. I am struggling, bro. I'm actively dying. I guess it's a good thing I got some home. Nailed it. Dude, we're up on a lot of stuff here. That was a That was a great raid. Uh-oh, my warehouse is full. There's no way. Uh, so we got more quests we got to do. I got to get more crafting. I also got to figure out what in the world I'm going to do about my inventory cuz it's a bit of a mess and what awaits us. And I suppose we can figure all of that out in potentially another video. Let me know if you guys enjoyed this. It's it's simple. It's intuitive, but the gameplay loop is fun. It's like extraction shooter but without as much pressure. If you enjoyed this video, I think you might enjoy this one. With that said, thank you very much for watching. Have yourselves a fantastic day. I'll talk to you in the next one. Very well.",
