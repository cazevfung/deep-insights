    "hey everyone, a little update: always hate feeling like i have excuses for every break, but this one was genuinely needed due to personal stuff that i had to sort out over the last 2 months. i know me saying that \"THERE WILL BE MORE VIDEOS I SWEAR\" can feel like an empty platitude given my track record, but i would like to tell you that there WILL be a 30-minute long video next week! (it is already nearly finished and i made sure of that before promising anything) thanks for sticking by me, and i hope you enjoy the chaos that i seem to always bring without meaning to :3",
    "12:43pm and you uploaded. I'll just finish my gooning with your video then.",

    "3:08 my friend puts his discord on \"do not disturb\" so I do exactly this to get his attention",
    "Watching Tux when he comes back feels like a new season of your favorite show just released",
    "AND THE CROWD STANDS UP THEN SITS BACK SO THEY CAN SEE HIM",
    "I love how the glue gun weights 4.6kg that's a lot of glue",
    "Please buxtird my baby boy release another vid before the year ends and my life is yours!",
