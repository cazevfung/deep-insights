    "Embark showed all other studios that it is possible to make an OPTIMIZED game on UE5 with destruction.",
    "arc raiders is the first big game in a looong time where im actively looking forward to it release. idk why but arc raiders during the server slam sunk its claws in to me and i am just looking forward to jumping in again",
    "I don't care if it's ANOTHER extraction shooter or ANOTHER battle royale as long as it's unique and good and has players !",
    "As a concept, extraction shooters with permanent gear loss are great game mode for tension and replayability. It similar to a battle royale, but killing everybody else isn't the only way to win, you can loot something good, extract without killing anyone and thats a way to win.",
    "Arc Raiders will become the first mainstream extraction shooter. It's on consoles, plays well on controller, its third person which appeals to wide audience, and its systems are more friendly and easier to understand then something like Tarkov.",
    "1. Where did Mat Piscatella get that data? Is it NA and EU market data, or does it include the Asian market? Because that’s one of the most surprising claims I’ve heard. 2. Focusing on PVE players can be risky, focusing mainly on casual players is also a big risk because casual audiences often move on quickly. That’s why it’s important to invest in your core, dedicated players. A recent game that make this mistake is Dune: Awakening. 3. I also talked about this in more detail, discussing how the game could be more engaging and comparing Arc Raiders to The Cycle: Frontier a very similar game that did some things better but also made key mistakes. 4. Marathon feels like a less engaging version of The Cycle: Frontier. 5. Thanks for reading, and keep up the great work, GameSpot.",
    "I knew Arc Raiders was a masterpiece after hours of play, but I didn’t realize that Embark was such a prodigy studio.",
    "Not a single extraction shooter yet has hit a massive mainstream success like several BRs did, so it kinda makes sense devs are trying to break it with their game",
    "Not that i dont like the rooster by why the rooster as the pet that gets the materials? Is there lore on this lol",
    "Sure hope they explore the more pve like gameplay. Maybe add incentives on some maps to help make people work together. Like huge bonus for 2 or more solos exfilling together. Was so jazzed when it was going to be a pve game! :( maybe as the studio grows they will add enough folks to be able to do a good pve game right. Five years later....",
    "There is not a decent extraction shooter on the consoles until Arc Radiers comes out.",
    "For one thing, you don't have to pay a writing team . Seriously though, I miss the days when games had both campaign and multiplayer modes. Arc Raiders has real potential for popularity in both.",
    "why is there a narrative that theres like a market saturation of extraction shooters? its in every conversation about it -- oh everyones making it -- like i can barely name 5 of them, and not all of them have penetrated the mass market yet.",
    "Theres like 3 extraction shooters on the market right now. Where does the idea that this is a saturated market come from????",
    "MWZ made me fall in love with the idea of an Extraction Shooter. I love Battle Royales AND Extraction shooters (I love Rebirth Island)",
    "A few probably will succeed. Tarkov being the established game will be fine and as of now it seems like Arc Raiders will be the first true mainstream hit. Overall extraction shooters seem to be like all the companies trying to make a battle royal after PUBG and Fortnite found incredible success except that all these companies are trying to be the first mainstream hit and the publishers are betting far too much on being that first breakthrough hit.",
    "Arc raiders reminded me to the good day's playing Day Z arma 3 mode. the game PvEvP is actually really good but it will need more enemies variety to keep me playing.",
    "I hate the conversation about \"Why is Everybody making Extraction Shooters?\" when there is literally only a few games in the genre compared to LITERALLY EVERY OTHER GENRE. Why not ask \"Why is Everyone making Soulslikes?\", \"Why is Everyone making \"FPS Shooters\" , \"Why is everyone making battle royales?!\" I could go on and on, but the extraction shooter genre is the one that should not be talked about in this regard. I think its more of a distaste from gamers towards the genre then there being too many games in the genre.",
    "Just played Marathon, horrible game. ARC Raiders cannot release sooner, that game was so fun.",
    "Love these videos. Just, you could put a little more effort into the audio production, the processing is not really working super well. Better EQ for Tamoor for clarity, levels balanced overall, and cleaner compression for dynamics would be good. Thanks for the vids!",
    "I get why a smaller studio is working on extraction shooters and that does seem sustainable with that environment. My cynical thoughts for larger studios though is that they're probably see it as the new hotness and publishers want to be the one who drops the first main stream title in hopes of capturing that new fortnite lightning.",
    "Easiest answer is because it’s the final form for shooters that people WANT to play. You get PvP action with missions and loadouts where no 2 runs or matches are ever the same. Extraction shooters is where it’s at.",
    "Honestly, those wave defence and boss fight missions could easily return as high tier End-Game activities. Would give you a reason to go looking for the best weapons and gear beyond just more PvP, without taking players from the main game mode (as you would still need to extract with gear, or the materials to craft it, to e en stand a chance on said mission) Idk, i think it would be cool but Reddit might disagree lol",
    "I feel like because current interest is low. Publishers probably see it as untapped potential. They probably see it as an opportunity to make the 'fortnite' of extraction shooters because it doesn't already exist",
    "I’d rather them make more extraction shooter than campaign games that I’ll only get 6-10 hours out of it after beating the campaign.",
    "I mean, the extraction shooter is a service game genre so there will be funding and that seems to be the biggest thing these days. And if Tarkov is the big name in genre, it's an easier pitch to say that you're making the \"More Accessible Tarkov\" to reach people that aren't playing extraction shooters now. I do feel like it's a fine line though. I personally don't like feeling like I got a diluted experience for the sake of accessibility, even if I'm new to a certain type of game. Like I never did end up getting into Monster Hunter after I tried Worlds - I did a bunch of hunts and realized the reason I was having such an easy time was because I had been using overpowered gear designed to make the game more accessible to newcomers (I had no idea! I was hoodwinked into playing the \"easy mode\", I swear!)."
