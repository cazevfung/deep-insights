    "“But gamers don’t like single player story driven campaigns” said every out of touch CEO in the gaming industry",
    "Bungie basically took one of their most interesting franchises that was rotting in their sex dungeon and made the most generic looking extraction shooter ever, all because the CEO probably wanted to add some extra cars to his collection.",
    "Why do I get the feeling Marathon will just stay like this but also Will get an overpriced cashshop that's gonna be filled with pointless garbage",
    "It’s such a shame seeing something like this come out of the same studio who once ran by the philosophy that “a game needs to be fun before it looks good.”",
    "I have a theory that this was Supposed to be a battle Royale, than they started falling off. Than they noticed that extraction game were getting attention. So they switched it to an extraction shooter last minute and hoping for the best.",
    "Reminds me of Evolve. 90% of gameplay is walking around looking for the enemy, 10% of gameplay is queueing up for a match.",
    "If it's already boring now, I have no clue how the devs expect this game to feel after 100 hours, or hell even 1000 if any mortal dares to even reach that milestone.",
    "Honestly when we inevitably get Marathon 2025 inspired mods for Cyberpunk, it'll be all the involvement with this game that I need.",
    "Can't believe this is what they did with one of the ancient titans of the FPS genre. God almighty, of all things to change into a quick cash grab extraction battle royale, to do it to Marathon...",
    "Marathon looks like Starfield's multiplayer mode that was cut to later be released as the separate game",
    "I feel like it really needs prox chat because that's what makes these games special and there's no choices to the gunfights there's no player to player interaction or teaming or ceasefires",
    "all the content creators whose future depend on marathon are sweating balls right now god this game is boring",
    "And to think, Bungie told Sony that Factions 2 wasn't up to snuff. And this is what they give us. Hoo boy.",
    "Bungie also released Destiny 1&2 unfinished at launch. There's no in-game customization so expect $15-$20 skins, a seasonal model just like D2 which most seasons in Destiny 2 are awful. I just wouldn't trust Bungie because of how they handled their previous IP and the community. 5 months to launch to do more work isn't enough time to finish it.",
    "I was never a big fan of Extract Shooters, so they lost me on the concept alone.",
    "Bungie executive 1: Hey we have a beloved series under our belt that we haven't used in a while. Bungie executive 2: so what do we do with it? Bungie executive 1: lets make a battle royale.",
    "2:04 I don't get why all these scifi games have zero imagination when it comes to guns. They all fire the same kind of ammo and have the same 30 round mags as contemporary machine guns. I swear Call of Duty has just absolutely gutted modern FPS games. We went from Unreal Tournament back in 1999 having guns that fire razor blades that bounce off the walls, and flak cannons that shoot chunks of molten steel out of a canister (and you could lob the canister like a grenade), to basically an AK47 with neon lights. Where is the creativity?! You're telling me in the far future across the stars this is the tech they come up with?",
    "'The character designs look good\" I'm gonna have to stop you right there, Chief.",
    "As a fan of the original trilogy, I am excited less and less with every passing day",
    "You know, if they really wanted to get people into Marathon, they should have just remade the whole thing. Every Halo fan and their dog would have been clamoring to actually play Marathon, the Legend they've heard so much about. A game that's so interwoven and interconnected to Halo, it's basically the origin of everything we've loved about Halo. That game that is for all intents and purposes, Halo's dad. Shoot man, I would have loved to play as John Marathon. All I have is lore and a computer that's too advanced to play it.",
    "the character design looked polar opposite. like you dress for a fun party or rave with colorful clothes and whatnots to attend a funeral. like if you want to make a serious narrative, then make the characters look serious, if you want a fun cheerful one then make the characters look cheerful.",
    "Like the cinematic trailer, Marathon should've been a single-player, story-enriched, open-world, rogue-like where the main appeal is trying to find and \"extract\" memories from a past life, previous play through.",
    "This is one of those games where the trailer looks insane then the gameplay is subpar",
    "So, this is the reason why Bungie left Destiny 2 to rot in a corner? Genius move."
