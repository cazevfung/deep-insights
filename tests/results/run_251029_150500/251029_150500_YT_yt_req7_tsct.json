  "content": "Much has been said about this world. About the sense of childlike wonder that its cold, stark beauty invites, about how a game can be intense, anxietyinducing, frustrating and relaxing, produce feelings of humor and aggression, fear and hope all at once. And for all this theorizing, it doesn't answer why this game works when so many others haven't. The beauty of a game like this lies not in how weapons or loot are balanced or an AI's behavior is simulated or in its graphics or sound design alone. It's not about what the developers intended. Rather, it lies in the subtle things that they didn't. Because Arc Raiders is not an extraction shooter. Well, it's finally here. Arc Raiders, as I'm sure you know. And if you've been subscribed to this channel for a while, I'm happy to say that this video is sponsored by Embark Studios. I've been a fan of and followed this studio since all we knew was that ex Battlefield developers were making an openw world PvE co-op game. It's been a long time coming. And while it feels crazy that after years of waiting, this game will finally be available to everyone on October 30th, 2025. that early lineage. It's actually really key to understanding what happened with this game. Since people first got their hands on it, much has been said about how Arc Raiders captured the extraction shooter genre's best qualities while avoiding its many pitfalls. And I mean, the people themselves have spoken. Yo, what's your favorite thing about this game, man? Uh, the sound and the uh the lighting. Easily the the audio. Uh, it's beautiful. I like the looting. The looting is pretty great. I mean, it's just it's just a good extraction shooter, you know. Audio. I like the audio, man. Audio is great. Visuals are great. Oh, my favorite thing about Raven so far, it would have to be the different people you can meet in proximity chat, you know. Uh, what's your guys's favorite thing about this game so far? Oh, dude, I talked to you in D. Oh, you already gave me your answer. Arc Raiders feels immersive. Arc Raiders encourages player expression and cooperation through proximity chat. Arc Raiders progression feels meaningful. extractions feel intense and filmic. Its movement systems feel satisfying and intuitive. Its AI animations lead to a world that feels alive. And yet, none of these things are genre specific. None of them explain why this game works so effortlessly in this genre where others feel forced. Emergence, intentional systems colliding with unintentional and intentional side effects. It's a state of gameplay that theoretically increases replay-ability and encourages exploration and creativity. It's also an idea that gets thrown around a lot in discussions of game design without much thought because something isn't emergent just because it can happen. Emergence specifically refers to an occurrence developers did not intend, which specifically then furthers the gameplay experience of the player. A glitch, an exploit, those are not emergent gameplay systems. They're always at play in any game. Physics, AI, pathing, movement, weapon, and consumable mechanics. Anything that happens happens because the developers put a system in play. And when these systems clash with each other with the player, the developer needs to ask themselves, what might the player want to do in this environment? And do we want to allow them to do it? This might not go as planned. So you guys might have to come pick me up. What? Oh, are you going to try and use the grapple hook? Oh. Oh, you're going to try to grapple the bro. No way. It did work. Yes, it worked. No way. That's crazy, dude. But where did you even go? I just grappled the wall. What do you cut and what do you allow through? Things that need to feel a certain way need to be handtuned. Things that should feel natural, uncontrolled are left alone. And in that interplay of systems, the genre fades away. The game ceases to feel artificial. The player no longer asks themselves what the right decision is in a given moment and begins to simply ask what is possible. And when things begin to happen that might be intended and might not be, but you can't even really tell which is which, that's when things start to click. We got another team down there. Should we be their friends? Let's recruit them to the team. Yo. Hello. Hello. Down there. Friendly. Are you friendly? Are you friendly? Up here. We're chilling. Okay, boys. Yo yo yo. Come on up. Come on up. There's a bombader down here. Should we go take it home? I'm super down. We all got enough stuff to take it on quite easily, I think. So, this is so It's so funny, dude. Oh, feel like I'm in an apocalypse movie, man. Oh, there we go. There we go. We got him. We got him. I got him. I got him. He's going down. He's going down. Well done. Well done. Well done. We just had the craziest firefight. Oh my god. Yeah. Get him. Get him. Oh, I hear I hear a bastion. Bastion. Where's Where's this box doing? He's right here inside to the left. Yeah, get wrecked. Ooh. Uh, people are killing us. People killing us. Oh, it's somebody killing everybody. Watch out. Watch out. Abney, you rat bastard. The feeling of intuition that this should be possible, so I'm just going to try. In game design, they call that intrinsic motivation. And it's often the start down the path towards emergence. The player should be able to do anything they feel intuitively that their player character should be able to do because firstly, that's just fun. But how the world responds, that should feel just as intuitive. Take the Ark. It's well known now that their movement and behavior is as realistic feeling as it is because it was trained via machine learning. These machines taught themselves to walk, to fly within parameters and with goals set by the developers, but that only really works because of a clear hard decision made by the developers early on that the ark are well robots. The way the player character moves, shoots, behaves, the way they interact with geometry, it needs to feel bespoke, under the player's control, clean and smooth and satisfying. But the ark, they feel both natural, anim animalistic, and also imperfect, artificial, because in universe, they are. And thus, any unintentional behavior they exhibit within a gameplay context, it kind of feels purposeful. I just don't want him to turn around like he's about. He just fell on his face. He just fell over. Did you see that? Did you see that? Yeah. I thought he like kaleido. He just tripped and fell on his face. The world should feel effortless. No one should notice the details, the breaks in the system. When you start with intrinsic motivation, design systems that allow that motivation to be fulfilled in action and wrap everything up in a setting, a presentation that allows these systems to feel sensical, natural. Even when things don't act how they should, you kind of feel like there's a reason. Okay. Okay. Protect me. Protect me. Here, I'll just throw the showstopper at him and then it's and then it's game over. Yeah, throw it. Throw it. You got it. You got it. Go. I'm trying. Guy. Okay, back up. Back up. I'm throwing the showstopper on him. Oh, there we go. Oh, he's just so He's so done. He's so done. That was scary. He's done dead. Matt, the back is up. Get out of there. What did you do? There we go. There we go. There we go. Why did you say that was going to be okay? I thought he would die a little bit faster. See, immersion, the tone, the feel of the world, it's the reason all of this works. We feel inclined to shoot at weak points on an enemy because they're the part of the enemy that looks weak. We hide behind cover from the predatory eyes of Hunting Ark because, well, that's our natural instinct for survival. We engage with the world in a way that feels the most natural to do in any given moment because the world feels real. For how much I've already talked up the incredible sound design in this game, the way the lighting and soundsscape bathes you in warmth or cold or buffeting wind, none of that is for show. It's the system that ties every other system together. Embark calls this game a quote extraction adventure, but that's not why I say this game is not an extraction shooter. Obviously, technically it is. You loot, you fight, if you extract, you live, if you die, you lose everything. All the key points of the genre are here in the best parts of the genre's best entries. That intensity, that teeth clenching last moment trying to get out alive. This game does them the best we've seen in ages. But the systems in play in this game, they allow you to play the game in other ways just as much as they encourage that core experience. Careful. Oh, he shot me. He shot me. Hey, friendly. Friendly. We're going to help you fight the Bastion. Friendly. Friendly. We're going to help. We're helping. We're helping. He's a friend of yours. The original vision for this game, a co-op PVE adventure, it never went away. It became one of the many states of play available to the player simply by just asking others if they want to. He's close. He's close, boys. He's close. And doing that, it doesn't feel game-breaking or exploitative. It feels natural. It feels intuitive. Thanks, boys. A dev studio like this, they could have focused on doing things they've seen others do well. on the supposed doctrine of successful extraction shooters, that anxiety, the gear fear, the intensity of a firefight, the balancing, what have you. And it's not like Embark didn't pay attention to these things and their experience with a purely competitive game, the finals and battlefield before that. They know how to do the game part of a game. But Ark wasn't built around its game type. The looting, the fighting, the game's mechanics. They're a sandbox that pushes and pulls players towards moments of cinema. They're the planned, purposeful foundation for those unplanned, unique experiences that you never forget. Oh god. Get out of there, buddy. Get out of there. Oh god. He's He's up. He's up. He's up. Oh my god. That one of them died. Oh, one of them just went down. Oh, what the hell is this thing doing? It's killing him. It like EMPed them. Just go. Just go, you guys. Call it and get out of there. Call it and get out of there. Just go. Just go. Just go. Just go. What is that thing doing? It's That's what it does. That's what it does. Oh god. We need to get it to diagro from that area. If you can run in there and call the elevator right now. Call like not obviously not this literal second, but as soon as it gets out of there. Okay. I think now would be your your time. It's kind of going to go now. Go now. Just go. Just go. Just go. Just go. He can't see you. Why are you Why do you have to be here? Two minute warning. Huh? Oh, help. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Going. Oh god. It's facing this way, so be careful. Oh god. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Let's wait and see if it goes away. Oh, it's on it. Dude, why? Oh no. No, it sees you. It sees you. It sees you. It sees you. It's on the thing, dude. It's coming to you. You need to You need to break aggro. If we can go around this way, we might be able We might be good. It's going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Yeah. Yeah. Go. Go. Dude, I'm hitting the thing. I'm hitting the thing. Call it. I'm calling it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, it's it it broke aggro. We're safe. We're safe. Yeah. Yeah. Dude. Oh my god. That was so close. The fact that it walked right back on top of it at the end, that's absurd, dude. And those moments, they're what the game is actually about. I think it's possible that those that don't get this game might simply be expecting something too specific out of it. Ark gives you back what you put into it. Whether that be camaraderie, action-packed competition, or openw world exploration, you'll find something cinematic and memorable. If you allow yourself to be open-minded, creative, and flexible, I feel it's perhaps no coincidence that neither of the foundational titles in the extraction shooter genre were actually built with that game type in mind at all. Arc Raiders immediately became one of the best extraction shooters ever made because it was never meant to be one. Was that us shooting? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they're throwing grenades at us. Oh, They're throwing a over there. Nice. Well done. Oh, sniper on the rock. Another one went over there. Shield's cracked. I'm going to go off. Yeah, I got one. I got the sniper.

I'm so screwed. Don't get it. God, dude. I'm trying to kill the freaking Hornet. It's so bad. Help. For the love of God. I can't help. I'm dead. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. He's trying to come and finish me off. He's trying to come and finish me off. Pushing to you. He's right here. Right here. Nice. Got one. I got shot from behind. Yes. Just try ahead. I'm super hidden. If somebody can try I I got cover. Get get him. Get him. Get him. Get him. Get him up. Okay. Go go go go fight. I got this. Oh. From behind. From behind. From behind, guys. Guys from northeast. From behind. I'm going to knock this guy out. Seal his shield stuff. Okay. Okay. Got to do it. Some smokes right there. I'm going to push this guy on the right cuz we need to push this guy. There's somebody on our left. I see where they are. Okay. I got a shield recharger. He's right here. guy on me. On me. Nice. Well done. Well done. Now watch this way. Okay. Uh one on top of the rock also. I'm dead. Copy. I don't see him. I found him. He's dead. He's dead. Yeah, but there's another one. Another one.

They're up on that ridge. That's the problem. Yeah. Here, I'll just do this here. I see him. I see him. I see him. Hold on a second. I need to heal. He's being lost. Hit bad that guy. On out. Close. Close. Close. Close. Right here. Right here. Sneaking up behind him. Keep him busy. Okay. One. One. He's He's He's electrocuted. Oh, there's two on me. Holy smokes. One down. One down. One down. I'm down. One. One. Very low. I I lit this guy up. He's going to You got him. You got him. Echo. Nice. Well done. Watch the guy from the left. There's still one on that. Devil's got the guy on the left, right? Yeah. Yeah. No. No. He's still up. You still left up. I know, but but I'm just saying we're safeish for like one second. I'm going to try and shield him and come to you. Yeah, I'm I'm up. I'm good. I got two more bullets in my one gun. One right there. Okay. Moving up under the rocks a little bit from the rear. He's inside. He is. Yeah. Yeah. He's hiding in there, dude. Okay. Yeah, they all died. They all died. They gave up. Nice, Echo. There's a lot that's been said about this world. I bet it's cold, stark beauty, but just as much, if not more, its ability to feel welcoming, to feel inviting. It's a world you simply want to exist in. There's that fear, that anticipation and unease. The feeling that you're always in danger, that predators stalk you around every corner. That primal urge to scavenge and then crawl, run, or limp back to your cave. that's hardwired into our DNA. But just as much is that sense of wonder, a warm, positive feeling that so few games can really capture, that welcomes you into a world, encourages exploration, engagement with the systems at play, that will give you these unexpected moments that'll stick with you in a way a clean kill or a hall of loot never quite could. When you simply crest a hill, take in a sunrise over a valley, feel the dew drops on leaves glistening after a night of rain, you feel like anything is possible because, well, in this world, it kind of is. I'm Rio and I like to talk about stuff that I think is cool. Hope you enjoyed this one. Subscribe if you're new here or haven't yet.
