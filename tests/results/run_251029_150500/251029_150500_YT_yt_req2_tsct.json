  "content": "So once you get to a point where a development studios developers are kind of losing faith in a project you're making and are speaking out because of how badly things are run, that's when you know you're in serious trouble. Marathon was already facing an uphill battle with the player count for the closed alpha showing a declining trend, highlighting how it's struggling to retain players over the long term. The critical reception surrounding what folks have played of Marathon thus far has not been very positive. It's not like this awful game, but it's not something that's inspiring a whole lot of confidence. Uh, a lot of people don't feel like this will be a live service that will really take the world by a storm, especially priced at $40 and tackling a genre, the extraction shooter genre, where it's not doing anything to really stand out from the established norms. controversies like this one right here where it it's very clear that Marathon overtly stole assets from an artist and a lot of their visual language seems to be kind of inspired by this artist specific brand of graphic realism that's kind of creating a storm that has paved the road to a game that was already kind of not wellreceived but is no longer being really supported because a lot of people feel this is just such an egregious thing for them to do. Developers have tried to address the controversy, saying that it was the fault of one former employee, one former Bungie artist who stole assets. But a lot of people are finding difficulty in believing that this could slip by. all the other artists who are still working on Marathon, who are still at Bungie, especially when there are employees at Bungie who follow the artist uh whose work was stolen. They have tried to address the controversy via streams like this one where they did kind of a chat with the community, but you can see right here from the likes to dislikes ratio and just how people are commenting that the reception has just not been positive at all and people are kind of losing a lot of faith in this project. And now we're getting to a point where developers are speaking out to a degree that highlights that the development process of Marathon has been incredibly rough. That feedback has gone unheard and a lot of people are really not happy within Bungie happy with the leadership at the studio. And so that's when when you've lost everyone including your own developers, that's when you know a project is in serious trouble. I I don't think Marathon really has much of a chance of success from where I'm sitting currently unless they pull some kind of overhaul of things. So, we talked about this Forbes article already from Paul Tassy. He spoke to employees former and current at Bungie who spoke about how morale within Bungie is in freef fall. The vibes have never been worse. developers are saying their concerns about what happens to Bungie when Marathon bombs so much of Bungie's destiny and no pun intended is riding on Marathon's success and so Marathon's failure marathon bombing is just something that Bungie cannot afford but that's the direction where this is headed currently there are seemingly no plans of a delay for the game currently even though a lot of people are suggesting that given the lack of content here and given just how feature and complete complete the game feels for its $40 price point for a live service that's going to be rife with microtransactions. Many are feeling like this game needs to be delayed, but there seems to be some stubbornness on that front. Combined with the fact that developers have been telling leadership what would and wouldn't work with this game, you know, as far back as 5 years ago. But many of those uh developers have said that the feedback has gone unheard. And so that leads us to a situation where yeah, the developers who knew what they were doing, not being heard has led to a game that ultimately doesn't appeal to Bungie fans, doesn't appeal to Extraction Shooter fans. It doesn't seem like it's appealing to anyone really. And now let's talk about what this developer said just straight up uh on social media. Though they did recently delete these posts likely potentially because of I don't know NDAs and potential legal litigation. I'm not entirely sure, but they were very blunt about what they said. And what they said was archived by numerous games media outlets like the game post here. The developer was just really incredibly blunt about the state of the studio and how there's an environment there where it just doesn't pave the road for developers doing their best work and for a vision really coming together in a cohesive way that prioritizes just a really fun product over just, you know, corporate practices. So right here we got a former Marathon developer who spoke out saying that as a former Bungie employee who worked on Marathon posts that were recently deleted. Feel for those still at the studio working with engine for those still at the studio working with engineering marathon leadership was extremely toxic and humiliating. I won't speak about the rest but bungie leadership needs to be gutted completely. And this is not the first time that we've heard about just awful leadership that not only paves the road for creativity kind of being hampered and it being limited, but also a situation where developers just don't feel happy working at the studio. It happened throughout the lifespan of Destiny. Tons of developers have spoken out throughout that game's development. But beyond that, Bungie leadership doesn't seem to have changed their ways with the development of Marathon, as we're seeing a lot of similar reports to what a lot of developers experienced with Destiny. There was a round of layoffs back in late 2024. And speaking out against that, he said, \"The leadership is the worst I've worked with at Bungie, rampant micromanagement, frequent toxicity, and violations of their core values, and no ability to execute on their multiffranchise vision.\" Every day was a fight for autonomy and trust. every day was someone telling me I'm not allowed to speak on any issue or problem in a professional tone. It was on our mind since the last layoffs in October of 2023. We asked Pete and his response was that it was a lever he'd pull again. They need to flush out leadership completely. My team was excellent, but it felt like everything else prevented us from doing anything meaningful. You look at recent successes like Clare Obscure or Expedition 33 and the commonality behind what kind of tied that whole team together was a certain level of kind of creative autonomy combined with leadership that had a strong vision but also let developers cook and fostered an environment where it didn't feel like their creativity was stifled. It was just like a small development team that was agile, that had a lot of talent and were in an environment where that talent was allowed to shine. But when you got leadership who let their egos get in the way, who think on a corporate level rather than on a creative level, who care more about the monetization rather than the art. And when you've got leadership who don't value the talent that make these projects possible, leadership might steer the ship, but you need a whole crew to run that ship. And when you don't value that crew and underestimate them and make them feel like crap and don't foster an environment where they're happy and content with the leadership and they feel confident in the leadership, you get just a messy development cycle and you get a loss in faith and you eventually get a situation like this where they start to speak out about the experiences that they've had which further highlight a studio that feels like it's in freef fall because their methodologies and their antics that uh they don't seem to be adapting. in any way, shape, or form that they don't seem to be adjusting in any way, shape, or form or learning from. All that's going to catch up to them. And it feels like it's Bungie's reckoning now with all of that catching up to them now. And during that time when the layoffs happened and when this developer spoke out, he pointed out, \"The repeated layoffs have only pushed the studio to rely more on contractors and even AI.\" Here's the exact quote from that developer. So, when I hear that they laid off another round of my talented colleagues and friends, I feel angry. They're not at fault. They're not the ones who need to be canned. and every round only strengthens their reliance on contractors and AI. What makes a great development studio is the nurturing of talent. When you've got the same people who kind of come together as a cohesive team over many, many, many years and it's those same people there and they kind of slowly foster in new people and then nurture those new people and you create this kind of environment where you've got this really positive cycle of uh talent coming in. That's when you get top tier studios who are able to be agile and output consistent quality. But when you've got a studio like Bungie where there's just constant turnaround, when developers are treated like crap, and when leadership just has no clue, no real creative vision or creative drive and are more about just kind of letting their egos and their uh their strive for monetization uh kind of hampering the potential of a project, you get a product like Marathon that in many ways feels soulless and you get an environment where situations like plagiarism happening repeatedly at Bungie it becomes commonplace with Marathon in particular being the most egregious example yet. Now, I previously talked about Paul Tassy from Forbes and how he's spoken to developers about prospects surrounding Marathon. Well, he released alongside that article this video 2 days ago titled Marathon there's no coming back from this now where he discussed some of the things that he's heard behind the scenes. And among those things was the requirements and the kind of criteria that Marathon needed to meet commercially in order for it to be considered a success or for it to make its money back. And what Paul Tassy heard was quote, \"I heard this needed to be in the top five of NPD sales for the year if it's going to be success or considered a success. Crazy. No way. There is no way.\" And I concur with that assessment based on not only statistics running how the closed alpha went and how quickly numbers dwindled when it comes to both the player base and also you know social media presence like Twitch viewership but also now when you consider the controversy surrounding it when you consider just all the negative PR that the game is garnering because of accusations of plagiarism that are not just accusations that's just fact at this point and when you've got developers who are kind of expressing their disdain towards leadership and their lack of faith in this project and their fear that this will bomb and uh just speaking out about how the direction of this game uh kind of went uh arai because uh developers who kind of tried to express their feedback were not listened to due to piss poor leadership uh who were just too caught up in their own egos and uh just deemed themselves to be superior in terms of uh what they believe to be the direction of the project uh that would garner the most success. All of that has culminated in a situation where just about nobody believes that Marathon will be a success. If this dies off and all of that time and money and resources and manpower were spent on a project that's going to suffer the same fate as something like Concord, uh then uh Bungie is going to be in serious trouble and the fate of the studio could be very much called into question. Somebody else who spoke to developers is Destin here who published the following video on his YouTube channel titled Inside Bungie's Decline: Former Developers Speak Out. Again, so many developers are speaking out that it highlights just how much trouble this game is in. That level of lack of faith we've already seen from the community, but when it's even happening from within, then you know you're really headed uh towards an iceberg essentially. So, this is what uh Destin heard. This is what a former Bungie developer told Destin. Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed. Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate first culture. internal language shifted from studio games and players to company product and customers during the Sony acquisition. And so I don't know there's some hints that the Sony acquisition only made that aspect worse. We have already seen that element kind of seep into Bungie even before the Sony acquisition. But yeah, I mean Sony's big push has been to, you know, make as many live services as humanly possible within a few years. That's why they bought out Bungie. There's just such excess and short-sightedness with this live service pursuit. And some of that short-sightedness within Sony has seemingly bled into Bungie itself and the way they think about their products now. No longer trying to push boundaries, but just trying to chase whatever they think will result in great monetization schemes based on, you know, market research. And then it doesn't help matters that Destin speaking to developers also heard that leadership within Bungie and the way uh just developers are treated and all that. Even Destin has heard from his sources that it is really not fun at all to work at the studio because of a culture that doesn't breed the greatest creativity, doesn't allow uh developers to really shine with their talent with developers telling Destin essentially a cool kids club at Bungie when it comes to who's favored and who isn't. You either agreed with leadership or were put on a list, berated publicly, and told your ideas didn't matter. One ex employee said, \"If they didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing.\" Again, this is just the height of ego, peak ego. What game development ultimately is is a collaboration. When you've got as many moving parts as game development has, you have to on some level be open to the possibility that maybe you're wrong. Even if you have a strong vision, you have to consider that maybe developers have some good points to make because they're actually the ones making it. Leadership is ultimately about finding that fine balance between kind of setting the course towards a vision that you have, but also being able to steer around within that journey towards getting to that destination when your crew tells you, \"Hey, I've seen something that maybe uh we should uh kind of look into and course correct around because otherwise the ship might sink.\" You have to hire the right people and respect that those people know what they're doing and give them some kind of grace to allow their knowledge to kind of be able to dictate some things here and there as well. When you completely close off yourself to that and then on top of that berate your employees and treat them like and create an environment that you know a lot of people are calling a culture of toxicity and a culture where people feel humiliated. I mean, that's when you get a a crew that just eventually stops caring and maybe even get sick and tired of what they're actually making and stop believing in it. And so, you just get worse results. In turn, you get an environment where former employees will say stuff like this to reporters like Destin. It makes me sad to know there's so many talented people that can make great things, but are still answering to management that can't stop shooting themselves in the foot. They make bad decisions after bad decisions. It's not even surprising when a new story breaks. And then another developer said, \"I just want the devs to be okay.\" Some more information that Destin unearthed based on the sources that he spoke to was that management has been obsessed with monetization above all else. And that's not surprising. We have seen how obsessed with monetization they've been based on just how heavily Destiny 2 was monetized. And so, it's probably going to be no different for Marathon. I get that games on some level have to monetize, especially when we're talking about live services that have to be maintained over the long term. But when that supersedes what should be the priority of a game, you know, to be fun, you know, that's why it's called a game, uh, that that's when you start to get deteriorating products that the community can very easily feel. I mean, you've got situations like this one right here, where another former employee claimed there was a concern about Trials of Osiris PvP armor being too attractive with its glow effect. The worry was that it was too good and would impact Eververse sales. The concern wasn't are we giving players something that is good and cool enough. It was we're giving players something too cool and that coolness might affect sales across the board. So that kind of mentality of let's give players less because monetization is a priority is kind of the thing the mentality that has infested uh the live service model and Bungie who kind of took the live service model and made it about monetization. It's that kind of mentality that deteriorates the potential of a game because it's not about giving players the most potential fun with the highest potential of a product. It's about intentionally diminishing potential to kind of manipulate players to ensure that monetization is maximized even if it means diminishing the creative potential and the design potential of a game. Uh it's about intentionally making a game worse so that players have to pay to make it better. Uh it's about schemes that ultimately is about how to extract the most money rather than how to extract the most kind of fun. You know, they talk about engagement and about having to make money, but the the money and the engagement follows if you make the most fun thing possible. And for some reason, that's an idea that uh is not sticking in the brains of executives and leadership. As paraphrased by the game post here based on what Destin had to say, staff recalled being scolded about monetization in internal meetings and described an atmosphere where making money often seemed to take priority over player satisfaction. They are happy to cut corners if it means making more money. They're happy to compromise your experience if it means making more money. That was the case for Destin. You can bet your ass that that's going to be the case for Marathon. I mean, they'll even go as far as compromising morality and ethics and they'll just steal other people's art to make their own lives easier. They'll profit off of somebody else's work and they'll do this time and again and get caught time and again. And this is just something that continues to happen. And it's just unacceptable all around. the way they treat developers, the way they treat players, the way they treat artists. Uh the amount of bad will surrounding Bungie right now is uh at an all-time high, I'd say. And you know, it's had some pretty bad instances of bad will before, but it feels like all of that is just kind of culminating into a a storm of negative PR that will mark the doom of Marathon. When leadership continues to steer the ship the way they currently are, there's just no other way to really fight that uh unless someone else comes at the helm to steer the ship. Uh unless leadership is changed and unless uh the person at the top dictating everything uh kind of is someone who does really care about the actual you know the actual integrity of not only game making and game development and the creativity surrounding that but also just how to treat players and artists and all that. Unless we're at that level, uh, you know, there's just no fixing this. And, uh, leadership seems too stubborn and ego-driven to feel like they have the need to fix it, uh, and to feel like they have any, uh, kind of necessity to change. So, with all that in mind, I um I just really have the worst feeling about Marathon. And at this level of developers speaking out, uh, it would seem as though developers feel the same way, or at least a lot of them do. Uh but you know, I guess only time will tell what the future holds for Marathon and whether uh all of this will kind of slap them awake and uh kind of allow them to come to terms with a reality that will force them to change course and to overhaul and to uh realize that if something doesn't give um this ship will sink or at the very least that's one man's take.
