  "content": "Apparently, consumer interest in extraction shooters ranks among the lowest. So, why do developers keep making them? Let's talk about it. So, there's a lot of chat about extraction shooters lately. Obviously, we have all the stuff happening with Marathon. Maybe not good stuff happening with Marathon, but we've also got excessive arc raiders. They just had the service land last weekend. And then the other day, Matt Piscatella, who works at Sakana, what's he up to now? What's he saying? He posted on Blue Sky, \"What's funny is that overall consumer interest in extraction shooters rates among the lowest across genres. And yet, why are devs so infatuated with this particular space? It's baffling. Is it a game maker's favorite kind of game?\" That is very surprising. I thought extraction shooters would be pretty high in terms of interest. If extraction shooters are a game maker's favorite kind of game in the same way that immersive sims are a game journalist's favorite kind of game. Oh yeah, that's a good way to look at it. Dishonored enjoyers are here. We had uh Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins came into the studio to talk a little bit about why people are making Yeah. I mean came in to talk about Arc, but then we were like, why do people keep making this? And he was like, first of all, relax. Second of all, let me explain to you why. So, we'll kick off with this quote from him cuz we asked about why Embark, you know, released the finals, working on the finals, also decided to get into the extraction shooter space. And uh turns out it was all thanks to a little pivot. Take it away, Virgil. The main factor that led to the pivot itself was the fact that we just couldn't get a game mode together that was repeatably fun. We had a lot of very interesting tech going into our enemies and like amazing art and and world building going into it, but the way the sessions were structured, you'd have fun maybe one out of 10 times. You knew you had to go kill a giant robot and that was cool, but there was nothing for you to do in between. So he tried more structured things like a mode where you went into an area and did objectives and then the giant boss would arrive or a mode where you were defending one of the outposts and it was kind of like a wave-based thing. And those were better, provided more structure, but again it lacked um a reason for you to ever repeat that because most of the the game lacked any sort of meta to it. You didn't have what we have today where you go back home and craft or do things or expand your your way of play. So, we just kept coming back to the fact that while it offered a novel experience, there was nothing to keep you coming back to it. You'd go, \"That was fun, but why?\" We had just done like a test, a public test, limited at the time. And saw the results from that and and the direction group at the time kind of went away and we had our big summer party and we're celebrating a good test and come back and they're like, \"Well, we're changing everything.\" Um, but it it honestly was for the better. Like I think a lot of us were unsure or or even skeptical of how we would ship what that game was trying to be. And certainly for us being such a small team relative to the amount of content that type of game implies, it really wasn't a good prospect for us to to make enough stuff that players would keep playing for that many hours. I think it really just made sense to move forward with the plans for PvE as a thing and then start shaping our game around that and then the meta that comes with it. So, how could we take the tension and the risk and the stories that come out of extraction games and put that into the world we've created and utilize all the learnings and PVE elements that we had to to make that into something from the outside looking in when I think about extraction shooters is something like a talk of doesn't feel very approachable to me and I feel like marathon certainly yes this is more approachable to me maybe in terms of the ease at which I guess you would kind of get in and like it didn't seem as daunting dealing with this this this and And so we talked to Virgil because you are not only competing with other games, you're competing against people's time. And so you want to make that on-ramp as easy as possible. So here's what he had to say about approachability. Very early it was trying to figure out in the metagame layer how we could kind of sand off some of those rough edges. You get in situations where you've lost a few rounds and now you have nothing left. and we wanted to just offer a a kit of gear to people straight away. So, we have a free load out that you can take at any time. There's no strings attached, but it's pretty limited in its capability. We still wanted you to have a minimally viable way to always play the game as intended. And then we also added kind of what we just call safety nets. So, one you might be familiar with is the the rooster that gives you materials to provide economic safety net for players. If you're not succeeding a lot, we still wanted you to progress incrementally and have a few materials on hand so you could craft like the gun you want to use or a piece of like gear or something like that. And then on top of that, it was adding a lot of ways to progress without succeeding. Do a quest, get some XP, finish a challenge, something. So these things carry with you even if you don't extract at the end of a round. I think the thing that really happens with extraction shooters is there's the story part of it. There is the starting hopefully ending with taking a big sack full of loot, you know, escaping by the skin of your teeth. The stories that we would play, like we're playing Overwatch or Call of Duty would be the stories of crap that we would say as friends, like fun bits. It would never be a specific moment in a game really. Whereas in Inraction shooters, it's like, \"Oh, do you remember when I got downed and then this and then I had this and you know, leaving that kind of thing.\" the kind of metrics that you use to judge whether you're having fun or being successful feel way more varied, diverse, and a little more forgiving on the extraction shooter side compared to battle royals and standard multiplayer games as well. You know, your kill death ratio, how you're contributing, but in an extraction shooter, it could be as simple as I didn't kill anyone, but I managed to get out with a new weapon. Yeah. So, it's not as contingent on you being super sharp with a mouse or a keyboard or or your controller and nailing head shot, which I think means, as you said, the barrier to entry and approachability is much better. So, you can do a bunch of different things. It's the same way that when we played Overwatch, it was like sometimes when you weren't having a great uh kind of session, you'd be like, I'm going to heal and I will be in the back holding M1 skillfree. Exactly. That means that even if you're not performing super well, you have a story to tell. you have you're contributing in a way that is still significant and I think that's something that extraction shooters get really really right even amongst the complexities of an extraction shooter design economy etc etc so arc raiders is out next week and it is very strange seeing the story of Arc Raiders versus the story of Marathon I don't want to certainly be kicking them while they're down want games to succeed here we actually spoke to Virgil a little bit not to you know dig or anything but to get his perspective on that comparison that's being made Like obviously there are a lot more extraction shooters. It's a much more invogue game mode. Yeah. But we were interested. It's like what's it like to watch when everything's going right for you but not necessarily going right someone else or someone else. I mean any outside information and that we can get is always great. So if if someone else can take a leap and maybe not succeed at it or or do and then have to reshape some other elements around it. I think that's good information to have. It was interesting during our tech test two to have them, you know, alongside us there and and kind of it was a very good sort of AB test almost of like things that we had opted not to do or had opted to do and how that kind of shook out. So certainly it's um good for contrast. I suppose the thing that I wrote about in my preview and we talked about is the game overall marathon. It didn't feel like it had something new to provide in the genre. And in the extraction shooter world, it's something that players can pick up on way more acutely than pretty much any other genre. And that's something I definitely picked up when I was playing it. I was like, \"Okay, this is a game that feels like it's ticking the extraction shoot boxes, but it doesn't understand or aspire to create the kind of magic that keeps that all that stuff together.\" for a game like Ark and for Marathon, they're also trying to convince people that all the time and money and, you know, effort they've invested in an existing extraction shooter should be left behind for a new one. And that is a tricky thing to do because you need a real unique idea. You need a hook of your own, but also you can't stray too far from what that core experience is, which is really, really tricky. And that is something we asked Virgil about. How do you strike that balance? and you know what is the key challenge for a new extraction shooter that you're facing and you know what Marathon is facing and no doubt what other extraction shooters will face. We've gone through internal iterations where we've had mechanics and then remove them even if the mechanic itself was pretty solid or fun. It did not make sense in the context of the whole game as I mentioned with things like uh our safety nets in the game. So free loadouts and and stuff. Other games have um like insurance systems for example to get some of your gear back and we tried stuff like that. It just really didn't seem to fit or it would have had to be been shoehorned in so much that we just kind of went for an alternate approach that ideally at the end achieves the same result but works inside of what our ecosystem is. So why do you think developers are so infatuated with extraction shoes? Do you think it's a boardroom decision? They see the success of things like hunt and tarov and are like hey we want to get into that. So Evan from PC Gamer replied to Matt's uh kind of statement. Extraction shooters are an evolution of an evolution and that's where a lot of like novel interesting new ideas stand and I think when you look at it from that perspective it can read as developers are interested in it because it does have that space within where you can be novel and create new ideas. You can have moments within moments. Yeah. The problem is you with meta progression on top of those moments. Exactly. If it's a evolution of evolution and the original starting point is something that you know is a success that being a first person shooter, you know that you're on a pathway which if you can get enough right, you have an inbuilt interesting audience already because people play shooters, you know. All right, thank you for watching another episode of Spoton. We'll be back again in a couple of weeks. Uh, in the meantime, you can find us here on GameSpot or Tam, you're at I'm tomorh.com on Blue Sky and to H everywhere else. I'm Lucy James Games everywhere. So, we will see you in a couple weeks. Thanks for watching. Bye.",
