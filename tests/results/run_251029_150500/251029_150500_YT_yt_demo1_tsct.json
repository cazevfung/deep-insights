  "content": "Well everyone, today we're trying something a little different. We are trying Arena Breakout Infinite, which just launched on Steam and is a freeto-play hardcore tactical extraction shooter that you should play without uh being distracted with uh doing a video intro. That's a bad idea. Spin move. Spin move. Running. Okay. Okay. Just lesson learned. Okay. I shouldn't I shouldn't record intros while we're while we're doing stuff. It's a bad idea. Bad idea. I'm going to get jumped. Now, I've actually played a lot of Extraction Shooters in the last year or so. So, when the devs over at More Fun Studios, the guys behind Arena Breakout Infinite, offered me the chance to try the game and share it with you in a video, I said, \"Sure, as long as I'm allowed to say whatever I want to say.\" And they said, \"Absolutely. Say whatever you want to say. We just want you to play the game and share it with your audience.\" And that's what we're doing today. So, thank you to More Fun Studios and Arena Breakout Infinite for sponsoring the video. But rest assured, I'm going to tell you what I think. And it just so happens that I am pretty impressed. Now, I've actually been playing it for a few days, and there's a bunch of little bitty quality of life things that are really important in an extraction shooter, in my opinion, that they get right here. For one, it's free to play, meaning that you can just load in and try it for yourself to see if it's your type of game and if it feels good to you, which is important because this type of game is not for everybody. And if you want to play with your buddies or at least get them introduced to the genre or to this specific game now, they can just easily get into it. But even if you want to play it solo, there are solo modes, duos modes, and of course the kind of core trios mode, which the game is mostly built around. There's all sorts of little touches. Like for example, if I want to check how many rounds I have in my magazine, you'll notice it's not on the UI like on screen. But if I just go alt t, you actually check the magazine by hand. You can actually like physically check it. If I swap to my shotgun and check that way, you can see, okay, I've got about half left. Okay, so maybe this would be a time to reload if I had ammunition. And once you start reloading, it plays out in real time. And so you can't just play willy-nilly. You know, this is not like a light-hearted Call of Duty type shooter. This is much more hardcore and tactical, even down to something as small in detail as the ability to sway and lean around corners to peak it. Now, they have five different maps right now available for you to try. And they have different playlists and loadouts available for missions with all different modes, for highle play, for introductory play. So, there's all sorts of different ways for you to sink your teeth into it, whether you're a new player or a very experienced one. And I will say the sound design is really good, and you'll find yourself listening very carefully. You hear that? You might need headphones, but you can hear the shots in the distance, and it's from behind the metal, so I know that there's a team in there looting it. So, I could I could set up camp here and just wait to snipe them if I wanted to to be a bit of a troll. Uh oh, my buddy's getting jumped. Uh yeah, I really I really need to be better about filming these videos with teammates. I feel so bad cuz I'll like go off and I'm filming something, I'm talking and rambling, and then my buddy gets jumped and uh that's just what happens. Oh, he's done. I'm sorry, dude. I'm so sorry. I am purely to blame now because this is a hardcore tactical extraction shooter. My teammate's just done. He's just dead and his stuff is gone. And that's sad for him. Again, I am to blame. This is my fault. But uh there's not much I can do about it now. You know, there's not a lot of, you know, quick res or anything. That's not really how this game works. You might also notice, for example, that I have that little orange minus uh ear icon in the bottom left. And that's actually an indication based on my load out. I'm wearing a helmet that actually suppresses sound. So, I can't hear cues as clearly as if I weren't wearing a helmet. They actually adjust the audio and uh audio balancing based on the equipment you have on, which is super super cool. Certain helmets, for example, have a visor that will literally limit your field of view. It's just really really carefully thought out and well executed if you ask me. Now, like I mentioned, there's a bunch of different maps and game modes for you to try out. I've played in multiple. My personal favorite is probably the TV station. Because it's a TV station, there's a bunch of different small vignettes built as sets throughout the station, and it creates for some really fun encounters where each individual encounter can take place in a totally different micro setting. It's It's very interesting and cool. Not to mention the tight corridors make it really, really intense when you're trying to hunt down other teams and take their loot. It's just really well executed in my opinion. It's big enough for you to get lost in and to find a bunch of new interesting stuff, but it's also intimate and tight enough in the important areas that you don't feel as though players can just run away from you and escape when you get to jump on them. They also have a limited time storm event going on right now where they take the farm map and add a ton of extra challenging things to it such as intense rain, a bunch of wind, heavy fog, reduced visibility, and the rain makes it louder so you can't hear enemies coming. It just takes all the knobs and turns them up to 11. It is much more intense. Another aspect of the game that I think is so so important in an extraction shooter or really any hardcore any type of game is that it needs to feel fair. Like it needs to feel as though when you died it's because you did something wrong or your team screwed up. Like it shouldn't feel as though the game just misbehaved. And I will give them credit. They've done a really really good job of tightening this up. Like I said, the game existed before it launched on Steam, but now that it's on Steam, a whole new wave of players are finding it, and it is just really well put together. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the movement to the inventory system and the actual builds of weapons and armor sets and everything. It's just all so robust and sturdy and well put together that it makes it feel like if somebody got to jump on you, it's your own fault. You weren't listening close enough. you weren't paying attention or you know you were recording the intro for a YouTube video while your buddy was alone off in the distance. Oh, like right here. I just heard a dude walking around. Okay, so there's a guard there. There are going to be some NPC guards on patrol, but then there's also players that will of course be exploring as you are doing your thing. And you just never really know. You can usually tell like visually they'll be wearing different outfits and loadouts, but but sometimes you just got to be cautious. I just heard somebody. That's a regular guard. He's just doing his thing. This game makes you so paranoid. I swear it's it's kind of awesome because I mean it's a tactical extraction shooter. You should play it very cautiously and not be playing like crazy. But, you know, I guess it's just proof that the game's working. It's making me act all crazy and hyper paranoid. Now, personally, I think my favorite part of the game that I've encountered so far is actually the weapon building, assembly, and modification system within the gunsmith. This is basically a system you can use when you're building out your loadout to go into a match. And it allows you to either build guns using attachments you already have, or you can buy them from an in-game store where other players can sell items they've collected, or you can buy them from a merchant that the developers have basically built out for you, though that's for a higher price typically. And there is a ton of customization, whether it's the barrel that you use, the specific rail you attach your scope to, the scopes of course, suppressors, compensators, muzzles, chokes, you name it, they've got it. and it allows you to build exactly the kind of gun that you want um for your play style, which again I appreciate. I tend to be kind of slow and steady, scout heavy, snipe heavy. Like that's just how I tend to play all sorts of games, but that's just me. Other people are going to be much more run and gun probably running in with SMGs and shotguns and stuff, and that's totally fine. In which case, you can build it out the way you want. Oh my god. Oh my god. These are all just the NPCs, so they're like not that dangerous, but they are just annoying enough for you to need to pay attention. He's wearing a helmet, so I don't think that domed him. Oh my god. Come on, Pika. There we go. Okay, not my proudest moment. I missed a few of those. Now, I was trying to come up with things that I had like frustrations over. Ooh, a hydraulic wrench for 65,000. That's nice. I was trying to like come up with the the points of frustration that I have with the game if there are any. And honestly, I don't really have any firm notes. Like I think it's a really wellexecuted extraction shooter and they've done a really good job. They've even directly responded to people's frustrations over like potential payto-in aspects of a game like this, which is crucial in a free-to-play game that it's not just pay to win, which is something that you can sometimes end up with in games like this. So, in response for this update, they actually removed the ability to buy the in-game currency you use to purchase gun attachments and stuff, meaning now it's just cosmetics only, which again, I think is really, really good, really healthy for the long-term life cycle of the game because it now means again when I go into an encounter, if I get jumped and get outplayed, it's because the other player just had better equipment or or was a better player probably realistically. And it was not because they just spent more money. It was because they knew what they were doing. And I'll be honest, so far that's been my experience in the game when I encounter other players. It's usually because they were posted up tactically and they were watching for me. They listened closer than I was. I wasn't paying full attention to the environment and I could have seen some indication that they had been there, like an open door, but I just wasn't thinking about it. And that's exactly what you would hope to see in a tactical extraction shooter. things that are fair, balanced, and that you could have picked up on if you had been paying more attention. One of the other things I commonly have to bring up with extraction shooters is the ability to play solo because these games can often be so dependent on other players filling out your team that one bad matchup can ruin your entire evening of playing games. Like if you grind out for hours collecting all this amazing loot and then you get matched with one random set of teammates that just are terrible, it can ruin your entire time with the game because they get you killed and you lose all of your stuff. And so having a solo queue can be really really nice because it means that you can just get in there, play by yourself. You don't have to worry about anybody else affecting it. It is just you and other solo players. And that for me is wonderful, especially if the game is balanced in a way where that can still be fun. That really makes a difference for me uh and the type of player that I am. And like I said, they have solo cues, they have duos as well in this game. And because it is free to play, you can just ask your buddies if they want to hop on with you, play around or two, and you can do that because there's no barrier to entry. You just download it and do it that way. You'll notice when I pull up the map, there's actually numerous extraction sites and different like points of interest on this one map. Like I said, there's five maps for you to choose from when you go into a match. But like this one, in order to unlock it, I have to search any five unarched weapon cases as a team to extract. This one, the canal gate is closed. Find the switch in the second floor of the control room to open it. This one though is active after 15 minutes of the raid. This one is a secret patch passage open 15 minutes after the raid starts. So you can pick which one you want and then go on from there. I will mention that my experience so far with other players and random matched teams in the game has actually been quite positive. They've been supportive and helpful and when we went into voice chat, they were actually helping me understand the game and learn some of the tips and tricks. And it was quite refreshing honestly to play a hardcore game where the community was just supportive and nice and kind and excited to have new players in the lobby and server with them which is not an experience I've had in a lot of other hardcore games. So it was nice to see cuz the community is not something you can like market into a game. It's not something you can force. It's just something that happens emergently. Like if the community is is chill that's awesome because you cannot fake it. You can't buy a good community. It just is what it is. And amazingly enough, they have a really, really seemingly kind and supportive community in this game, which is not something I can say about every game I've tried. So, props to whoever is responsible for that. I mean, maybe it's just luck of the draw or whatever, but ultimately, I guess it's the community themselves that should be should be uh thanked and proud of it cuz they're the ones doing it. But they've done a great job and honestly, it's so refreshing to see it. Oh, yeah. They were totally here. See, they're searching all of this. They dumped some other stuff they didn't need and then they extracted 1,000%. Okay. Well, I think that means I'm alone now. I think I think I'm solo. Well, in that case, we're good to extract. So, I'm just going to go stand in the extract zone for 10 seconds and then get out. I didn't collect a whole lot of stuff, but you know, we we proved the point that even a dude like me can extract. They also have a really cool like recap system in the game. So you can see everywhere you traveled and ran and where you didn't go. So next match maybe I go over to the armory and I search there because that's kind of like the main thing on this map. You can see a different timestamps when you either found a a unique piece of uh loot or maybe you went in and you found a a specific enemy and eliminated them. Like it's just a cool recap. I like that. But then after the match we're good to go in again. We just hit enter and we can choose which mode we want. normal lockdown which is like the next tier above that forbidden zone which is much higher tier. It's the extreme danger and just to play this mode you basically select which map you want to do and then you see there is a minimum value 300,000 and a 50,000 buyin. So it's not something you're just going to casually do when you first start playing. This is more endgame stuff. Similarly, they also have the solo ops mode which you can select there and then choose whichever map is currently available for it. It also has a minimum value as well to make it worth it for the other players if they happen to jump you. But once you select the map that you want, you select that. And let's say we're going to go Northridge. Let's select that. And then we're going to prepare our load out. And as you can see here, like I wanted more magazines for my rifle. So I just unload it. I have it here in my inventory. And these are those little like quality of life improvements. You just rightclick, you can search for it, and then you can find it available for sale. from other players or the marketplace more generally. And then you can just buy them if you need them using the in-game currency you've collected by selling other things you've collected. And then I have plenty of these uh magazines available to me. You can see when you highlight stuff, it also highlights the ammunition for that weapon and the magazines. So I can just like drag in a couple more of these if I want to have even more. I just drag on top of them the ammunition to load them up. I can also like just leave that in there. I drop the the mag into the rifle. Boom. I have it. Easy peasy. Lemon squeezy. I want more of this ammo. I can either transfer it from my inventory if I already have it, which in this case I do. I've got plenty. So, I can do that. And uh I'm I'm good to go. And then we load in, we pay our fee, and we start matchmaking to get in there. Again, it's all these little quality of life improvements and things that have not been in some of the extraction shooters I've tried this year. Let's just say that. Not calling anybody out, but you would hope to see some of this little bitty stuff that just makes it easier to get in and actually play the game and to just quickly do things like managing your inventory or your weapons or ammunition. I just love to see those things added here in a free-to-play game as well. It's just again really nice. And voila, we are in ready to go. You can select your POIs like if I want to get to Oh no. Oh no. So that that's what I get. That's what I get. You know, these these types of games can be difficult to film videos in because like you load in, it's like, okay, we're there. You pop in, you open the map to select where you're going, and boom, somebody spotted you and you're dead. Like 58 seconds is how long I technically was in the match while I was loading in and getting set up. At least, you know, it seems like it was a hardcore player that does this a lot. OP eliminations, total damage dealt, 400k, total value, 853 million. This is somebody who who has played a lot, so they know what they're doing. They were they might have been camping the spawn. You never know. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see him get me. As I'm like standing there opening the map, you can see. Okay, let's get in the game, guys. I'm really excited. He's like, what is this loser doing? And then I'm trying to frantically close the map and then Oh, well. Yeah, that's kind of my fault. Well played. What a way to end it. Thank you again to More Fun Games for sponsoring the video, giving me the chance to check it out. I'm actually having a really, really good time. And again, I can't say that about every extraction shooter I've played this year. um that got quite old quite quick. And this one has a lot more content, a lot more quality of life improvements, which are also really good to see. And um when you die, you also get a clean recap of exactly what they used on you, what weapons they used, what ammo they used, where the bullets hit, and everything, which is honestly kind of cool. Um I died because of the hit to the head. And uh there we go. There you go. But of course, if you want to check out the game yourself, it'll be linked in the description box below. And like I said, it's free to play, so you can just download it on Steam, check it out, see if it's up your alley, and give it a shot. But with all that said, thank you for watching. I love you all desperately, and I'll see you in the next video. Hugs and kisses. Bye-bye.",
