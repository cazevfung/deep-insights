    "When even the devs no longer believe in what they're doing to the point where they feel the need to talk about their harrowing experiences with leadership, maybe it's time to consider some massive changes to leadership. Otherwise, they'll steer the Bungie ship directly into an iceberg.

    "Imagine naming your game Marathon and it dies before getting to the starting line.",
    "Bungie went from \"the team that made Halo\" to \"the company logo that used to make Halo\"",
    "CEOs will never comprehend that if you make a great game, money will make itself.",
    "\"hey Bungie, instead of making a deep story driven single player experience we would prefer a live service extraction shooter\" said absolutely no one ever",
    "The way bungie has fallen is absolutely tragic, it was once my fav studio.",
    "I saw an article that said that the likely reason the leadership is not delaying the game is because when Sony bought Bungie the leadership was supposed to get a big payout in 2026 through stock options after they become vested. But if they delay the game into 2026 they could either be fired before they become vested and not get the payout or their vesting will be delayed. So they are trying to push it out by the end of 2025 and then get their payout in 2026 and then abandon Bungie and let Sony deal with the mess they left.",
    "How Pete Parsons is still CEO and Chairman of this company is far fucking beyond me at this point. How many more sports cars does the guy need?",
    "I mean what do you expect from a company scummy enough to \"vault\" and take away stuff from people who already paid for it? Of course they are criminally stealing stuff and treating their employees poorly. There were reports they were firing people before they could retire because the stock prices being high would allow them to retire with more money. I am more and more glad and confident in my decision to not support modern Bungie things or try their games. They are trying to replace their artists with ai too and treat their own horribly.",
    "Meanwhile, there's a little decent Animal Crossing-like game called Fantasy Life that just released a sequel that will probably be more successful than Marathon at launch Edit: The game has already sold half a million units!",
    "We painted Activision and Sony as the villains behind Bungie for so long when Bungie was the bad guys in their own story. Wild",
    "Man, remember when Bungie was at the top of the world in the late 2000s and everyone loved them? I miss those days",
    "Currently playing the original Halo games remembering not just what the games were like, but also what the Bungie of old used to be.",
    "As someone whose going to college for business with the intent of opening a modest game studio, this inspires me to keep going. These devs aren't the people that made Halo, but they clearly still have some talent. Talent that is trampled over by higher ups whose only ideas for raising profits come from chasing tends, squashing any innovation and creativity that might make their products stand out. Every catastrophic failure serves as a new addition to my playbook of what NOT to do once I get my master's, and I can't wait to get into the game.",
    "The same stuff about leadership and work culture within Bungo has been said for like.... multiple years at this point We never had any news about leadership being fired, none of them. We still get articles every month",
    "The one thing Marathon had going for it was the art style. Whoops.",
    "How hard is it to see the writing on the wall and cancel the game before it gets any worse?",
    "Imagine if Bungie actually hired the artist they plagiarized. For one, it wouldn't cost them that much in the grand scheme of things, two, they would have a unique art style for a video game, and three, this massive problem wouldn't have come up because they hired the artist.",
    "Sony axed ten live service games after Concord. One can hope that this will get them to wise up axe them all togther, but I know better than to think company leaders can think. As for Bungie, they went from soaring, to dragging themselves off the ground, to jumping into a volcano.",
    "I remember about 10 years ago someone made a video about what if Bungie went back to Halo. Seeing this it's a scary thought",
    "I just want to put something crazy into perspective: SCHEDULE I, a game made by only one person, is probably going to outsell Marathon, a game made by 300 to 400 people. Do you know how pitiful that is? Even worse when you throw in the plagiarism.",
    "They all know it’s over. Sadly, I’ve known it was over since Season of the Plunder. It’s really sad that they had an absolute money printer in Destiny and they couldn’t be bothered to do the bare minimum of releasing an expansion and a few seasons every year.",
    "The plagiarism isn't an isolated incident, though. They did the same thing a couple years back in Destiny 2, they just didn't have backlash that was this severe last time",
    "Bungie devs will soon be putting fries in the bag and all the managers, directors and executives will magically fail upwards - it's endemic in the industry",
    "If the devs tell you to boycott the game they are working on, then you know the project and the company has problems.",
    "Ah yes, John Former. The international phantom thief and arch nemesis of Bungie, who has somehow infiltrated Bungie at least five times, just to steal artist's assets and discretely insert them into Bungie's game projects. Fortunately, this time they've definitely caught and fired this criminal miscreant, and this incident will definitely for sure never happen again this time. Anyone stupid enough to believe Bungie's excuse should not be trusted to make any meaningful purchase decisions beyond convenience store cup noodles.",
    "Sad thing is that even if Leadership gets cut, there will always be another studio that will welcome them Cant say they are \"incompetent\" because they are obviously making short term money even if that means burning down to cinders the studio and its games. Just unsure how they keep landing the same CEO jobs with no repercussions.",
    "\"Let's reboot our original single player first person shooter as an online-only PvP extraction shooter.\" And the accountants wonder why line keep going down.",
    "I’m honestly surprised it’s taken this long for this to come to a head.",
    "When enough is enough, the skeletons once hidden in the closet are starting to crawl out",
    "Really didn't think it could get worse than Concord. This is definitely worse.",
    "With the Marathon reboot's nightmarish production. It reminded me a lot like Fallout 76's development cycle where nobody wanted to even make the damned thing."
