  "content": "Now, I'll be honest. I was really hoping I would be wrong about this game being boring, but I literally cannot describe it in any other way. I lasted about an hour, played four matches cuz it took forever to load in for some reason. And then I realized something. Marathon is incredibly generic. Where's the game they were hyping up on that live stream, huh? It's the most battle royale feeling extract shooter I've ever played, but it's not supposed to be a battle royale. The main objective isn't just to kill. It's to get in, get the loot, and get out. But after playing, I had very little desire to even just get in. The whole experience is just bland, uninspiring, and boring. Now, let's start with the obvious, those graphics. Now, I don't mind style and artistic flare when it comes to gaming. I'm not super picky like I used to be when everyone just wanted games to be basically real life. But this is just generic looking. Remember Babylon's Fall? How it was supposed to look like an oil painting, but just ended up looking like Dark Souls alcoholic uncle? Advance Marathon. The character designs look good. The guns look all right. The structures are okay. I guess very copypaste. But the only nice thing about the areas are the skyboxes, which Destiny also did unbelievably well, but also making the overland look beautiful. Marathon is just bland. You can't have that for an extract shooter where the main point is exploration and looting. When I look at the map, I have very little desire to go around and explore it cuz it's just so artistically deprived. It's not pretty or stylized. It just looks kind of lame. This isn't a battle royale. Fast-paced in-n-out looting. Get to the zone. No, this is a slow and meticulous extra shooter. Two maps with so little variety it's astounding. Look at Tonka. Massive map. Bunch of areas to explore, all heavily detailed. Hunt Showdown. Unbelievable looking game. One of the most densely packed maps you'll ever experience. Sea of Thieves. Sure, not a full extract like game, but similar concept and does that cartoon graphic style insanely well. Arathon just looks so boring. And then you get to the gunplay and it's supposed to be great because of Destiny, right? Nope. It's just clunky and slow. I knew it'd be slower than Destiny or more competitive games like Apex or War Zone cuz it's more focused on looting and such, but this is just boring to play. The gunplay is basic. The abilities for the characters aren't unique or new. All in all, after four matches, I tapped out and went back to oblivion. Even my friends who got into the alpha couldn't be bothered to play with me. The pros are pretty much that it's got an interesting concept and that the classes look cool, but other than that, it's a very glass half empty mixed bag of shooters. The graphics don't need to be stellar. The story doesn't have to be amazing, but if the gameplay is boring, you've already lost. Concord just taught the ultimate lesson, but Marathon is not in any way trying to innovate or change the genre. It's just another generic shooter looter with the most mundane extract mechanics possible. I'm still trying to hold out some hope. It's alpha. I really hope they do something to spice up the gameplay. Maybe make it look more appealing and attractive or something. Cuz right now, this might be one of the most boring shooters I have ever played. It's not bad or garbage. It's just not really fun. And I'd love to hear your thoughts on it, what you think, if you're playing it right now. Because at this point, I do not see Marathon having a very long life.",
