My organization has a 144,000+ file monorepo, and currently it feels like Neovim plugins can't really capture that complexity super well. As I see it, it sounds like most of the AI plugins that will be able to compete are going to need some kind of DB to store context, so what exactly that ends up being is hard to know.\nI'm wondering, primarily for plugin authors in the AI space, what you think of this problem and where the challenges are with it? With Cursor being private, and a company, they can use a number of different pieces of infra to manage the functionality of codebase aware context.\nSo this is more of an open exploration instead of a \"oh shit what are we going to do\".\nFirst off just know that cursor is not using your entire codebase as context. For that large size that is pretty much impossible and would drain the bank account. Let alone context window limitations and how slow it would be.\nI believe many of these AI IDEs are using a combination of high level symbol summaries (eg function signatures), dependency relations (what imports a file is using), LSP references (what files are using a function for example), some grepping of keywords, what files you currently have opened and what files you have recently opened.\nI agree plugins will lag behind, but all these things are doable… I think the UX of it all is the hardest part.\nIt does but it does it by vectorizing your code into a knowledge database and then using vector search to extract relevant pieces of code and inject them into the context. It’s easier for a paid for IDE to do this as they control the entire ecosystem and most probably the average user won’t use enough to pass the cost of the subscription.\nOpen source could do this but then you would have to setup the vector database by yourself which the average dev wouldn’t do. Also, a plugin author has less control over your entire codebase so the entire plugin setup wouldn’t be so pleasant.\nThe vectorization process also takes quite a bit of time so my guess is that Cursor does it by sending the code to their server and processing the files on the server while an open-source project would be forced to do it on the user’s machine or force the user to setup a VPS to do this. All of these options are less then ideal.\nWhat do you think of AIDER? It is editor-independent, so you can use it with every editor, including Neovim\nsolves this problem exactly, and better.\nsimple, don't use AI as a crutch\nThey hated Jesus because he told the truth\nYep, open source doesn't care nearly as much\nAgreed. I use Neovim with an AI plugin daily but still turn to Cursor occasionally—it excels at capturing the entire codebase's context. That said, I'm fine with a less capable AI plugin since it forces me to think critically rather than defaulting to AI.\nAI plugins will take time to catch up to Cursor. The former are free, often maintained by one person, while Cursor has full-time devs and VC backing. The incentives just aren’t there to close the gap soon.\naider is the open source answer to that. it can build up a repo map of your codebase using the most important classes, and functions along with their types and signatures. This context can be sent to the LLM of you choice.\naider/coders/base_coder.py:\n⋮...\n│class Coder:\n│ abs_fnames = None\n⋮...\n│ @classmethod\n│ def create(\n│ self,\n│ main_model,\n│ edit_format,\n│ io,\n│ skip_model_availabily_check=False,\n│ **kwargs,\n⋮...\n│ def abs_root_path(self, path):\n⋮...\n│ def run(self, with_message=None):\n⋮...\nIt also does some optimization by sending just the most relevant parts of the repo map using a graph ranking algorithm.\nHere's some more info about how aider builds the repo map:\nhttps://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html\nI find Aider tries to do too much. The couple times I tested it tried to install dependencies and run commands. While this appears to be fine, the deps selection was poor, many already legacy and at the end it failed (during both tests).
