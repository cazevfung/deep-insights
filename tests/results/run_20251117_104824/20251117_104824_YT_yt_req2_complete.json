  "transcript": "Everyone's talking about AI companions, but Tolen takes a completely different approach. Instead of trying to be human, it's literally an alien friend from planet Portola. And honestly, that's kind of brilliant. Here's what makes Tolen unique. It's not just another chatbot. Your Tolen remembers everything from past conversations, grows with you, and has this quirky alien personality that somehow feels more genuine than most humanlike AI assistants. You can literally talk about anything from creative brainstorming to deep emotional stuff and it responds with this mix of curiosity and support that actually works. Now, let's talk pricing because this isn't cheap. You're looking at about $70 a year or 10 bucks monthly. There's no free version, just a trial to get you started. That's definitely a commitment, but here's the thing. Most users seem to think it's worth it. The voice chat feature is where Tolen really shines. Having actual conversations instead of just typing makes it feel way more natural. Plus, you can customize your Tlen's appearance and personality, which adds to that personal connection. But here's where it gets interesting. This app requires a subscription for everything. No basic free tier, no limited features. You're either all in or you're out. For some people, that's a dealbreaker. But others appreciate not being nickeled and dimed with inapp purchases. The biggest complaint I am seeing is the price point. $70 a year for an AI friend feels steep. especially when you can get chat GPT plus for similar money. But the users who stick with it seem genuinely attached to their tolins. Bottom line, if you're looking for a truly unique AI companion experience and you're willing to pay for quality, Tolen might surprise you. The Alien Concept isn't just gimmicky. It actually makes the interactions feel less awkward and more fun. If this helped you out, hit like and subscribe. I break down the latest and most talked about products side by side every week.
