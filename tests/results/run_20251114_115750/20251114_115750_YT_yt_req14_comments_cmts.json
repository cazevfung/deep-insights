    "Hi, I think that what you're referring to is simply the difference between 'strategy' and 'implementation'. I'd rather see Management Consulting as an umbrella term which constitutes of Strategy and Implementation (Operations) as two different components in general, rather than seeing 'Management Consulting' and 'Strategy Consulting' as separate roles altogether. The reason is that although there are firms that specialise in one of those (like MBB specialise more in Strategy and Big 4 have more Implementation work), they still try to expand into the other. That is, MBBs are increasingly trying to up their implementation game, while B4s are trying to up their strategy game (Monitor Deloitte for example). This means that an MBB 'Strategy Consultant' may be required to do implementation work too if the project so required and similarly for Strategy work in B4. Therefore, I feel both may be more or less transferable enough to each other so much so that we can group them under the same term 'Management Consulting' while seeing them (Strategy, Operations) as two different kinds of work within it. In fact, that's how I've seen people use the term 'Management Consulting' mostly. About which career path is more suited for C-Suite roles - I saw a video by another Consulting YouTuber 'Firm Learning', an Ex-McKinsey guy who works in C-Suite now with a retail company. He says that 'implementation' work is equally important to his role and also cited example of how implementation of PayPal took his company 3 months instead of originally estimated 3 weeks, the gap he didn't really imagine would be there when he was working in Strategy. Judging by this at least, what I understood is that implementation (i.e. what you refer to as Management Consulting in the video) is equally important for a C-Suite role What are your thoughts on this?",
    "Management consulting focuses on improving operational efficiency, while strategy consulting drives long-term business goals. Using Jeda AI enhances my insights in both areas, making it invaluable for effective decision-making!",
    "Oh wow, I never knew there was more to management and consulting. My degree in Business Management could be a great asset to me...",
    "Can you get into this at age 38? Also, I think plenty of SMEs cant afford these big firms have great need for someone who advice on strategy AND assist with implementation.",
    "As a Consultant you would be working in various industries anyway either as a Management consultant or strategy comsultant. Both are very good areas to work for variety of industries and work. Alot of strategy work is also done in Management consulting now as alot of consultancies expand their capabilities and offerings.",
    "Hello from Thailand!!! Your video is very good. I’m really interested in the world of management consulting right now and your video helps me a lot. Thank you very much",
    "I am late to this video but this is great and it helped a ton! I am looking to switch careers. I am a former Middle Market banker, and I’ve decided that I want to go into consulting after speaking with a few professionals. I figured strategy was where I wanted to pursue but wasn’t really sure. This overview has helped and I’m sure I’ll learn even more after my certification program with Harvard Business School Online.",
    "Have an MBA admission interview in a few days and this video really helped me gain clarity on my answers for career goals! thank you so much. Will definitely look forward to your program once I get into my dream B school. Cheers!",
    "Hi, thanks for this amazing video. I was very much unaware of the finer differences between strategy and management consulting. One question - As a student with about 2 years to graduation, how should I differentiate between what consulting roles are strategy or management? For example, when I apply to a BA position at McKinsey, is there a way to know if it is either of the two? Thanks again and please include your name in the video next time so I can directly refer to you!",
    "I have a question. You are a strategy consultant, when a project comes from a client is it you or your team that decides on how a strategy takes place for that company?",
