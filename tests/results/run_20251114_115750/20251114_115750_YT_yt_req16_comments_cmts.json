    "Nature of business changes every few years. And external nimble startups will always do it. Today's large corp were also start ups. AI tools are not the death nail - but an enhancement tool. Todays consultants - are preparing all the different tool boxes for the client. The information is all there on the net. But what to use. And IMPLEMANTATION.. that is the key.",
    "Hi Pavan, I am highly interested in such type of videos. After watching some of your videos, i got an insight that mostly you talk about the problem and less of solution part. I would like to see the both sides of it. Please keep building these videos deeply and solution oriented. I am an Indian Chartered Accountant",
    "20 years of consulting case knowledge is with the firms, what they researched, how they proposed etc. i agree that no of consultants will reduce to solve a case with AI, but all along the organizations will remain as they have specific data for specific industries.",
    "As a former McKinsey consultant, I am 100% sure that AI does not mean the end for the MBB consulting firms, and I think we ought not engage in scaremongering. AI brings change - and change has always been an opportunity for MBB to create business. To go in more detail: 1. Data analysis constitutes one element of consulting firm's work. However, it is way more important to have somebody who is able to navigate the data flood, synthesize the key messages and present them in a way that convinces people to act. 2. Very often, the challenge is less to produce data, but rather to ask the right questions in the right moment. The MBB firms have mastered this skill. 3. AI is triggering a productivity revolution, and both consulting firms and clients benefit from this. Usually though, as kings of the service industry, the top consulting firms are fast in pushing their learning curves ahead of those of their clients - and get hired to help with reaping the full benefits of AI technology. Hence everybody worried about the prospects of a future consulting career - keep calm and go ahead!",
    "Consulting companies survive not just in framing the questions and putting in nice looking Powerpoints but also by having a structured approachbin asking those questions. Every client may look like a single company but inside it is silo of departments with data locked in minds of people and people resistant to change. Sales dept will not share info with supply chain and supply chain will not share with finance and so on. That is why clients hire consultants to help them collate this information from different departments and finally align them to future state. Can clients not do this by themselves ? No , unless they have a dedicated persistent project mgmt office that runs across departments. Clients generally do not have this as its costly. Hence they hire consultants on need basis to get alignment across departments. In summary, consulting companies have threat from AI in preparing their due diligence questions but not a threat where they help transform a process. For that humans will always be needed.",
    "Nice video Pavan! Was expecting you to talk about AI's impact on Consulting soon. I remember in Dec 2022, right when ChatGPT was unveiled to the world, we had a discussion about ChatGPT and Dall-E in our Blue Chapters Community. It showed some promise but it was mostly exaggerated but fast forward to 2024, now AI is threatening multiple industries, even Management Consulting. I was aiming to be a Management Consulting but with the rapid rise of AI, I switched course last year and started learning about AI. Also, wouldn't MBB have predicted this years ago and would it be possible MBB is actively trying to ramp up its services with newer products integrating GenAI? I feel they still have a chance to continue if they are able to innovate using GenAI as they have a strong client base with relationships spanning decades and it can't be built within a few years even with AI. What's your take on this?",
    "As an MBA aspirant and someone who has a decent grasp over the development of AI, my personal take is that AI is definitely going to impact the field of management(not just consultancy). The number of management graduates required for a particular task would decrease and it will keep on decreasing. So yes, MBA is not going to a viable career path for most students, only top colleges will be able to place the students. Also those who have jobs, there would be a sword hanging around their neck as to when some new technology will be developed which can replace them. The rate of technological development will be insane in the AI era. There is going to be a blood-bath real soon!",
    "It is not \"globalization\", but rather \"geopolitical contests\" that are making collaboration between different offices more difficult!",
    "Make a video in power space since without electricity AI will be crippled & my 3 takeaways :- 1. AI is evolving much faster & better than humans. 2. AI delivers more at less cost. 3. AI is quicker than a consultant in data analysis, structuring & asking questions.",
    "As an AI Developer, I've built agile custom solutions that match/outperform the big 4! Happy to share & discuss",
    "Hi @Pavan Good insights. PLG strategy should be the way forward for the consulting companies. There has been a good change in the ‘Enterprise Decision Makers’ preferences - they are expecting more transparency (black box is no more exciting), they want to cut down the costs, they are expecting a unique/custom solution to them (no more advising similar future plans to similar business). Another key factor apart from Globalisation is - ‘Emerging Tech’. Everyone wants to stay of top of Tech but there are too many pitfalls. Gone are days where innovative enterprises run after emerging techs. The decision makers want more clarity, use cases, proofs and clear picture before adopting a tech. Yes AI will impact - it will hit the “expertise” competency of the large consulting firms. Such competencies will be “immitable” with AI. My guess, companies who does “Implementation” will have an edge. Eventually we could see - McKinsey + TCS kind of collaborations more.",
    "I think consultants will survive, and the best will be very much in demand - those who are emotionally intelligent, expressive, articulate and gifted with clear thinking - but, the bulk of consultants - and people in general - are missing some of these qualities, the PowerPoint and excel drudgery will be handled by AI, it’s probably going to shrink the headcount Not only this, but how many organisations will seek to express their transformational views via AI and in so doing shrink the headcount again. As I said consulting will not die, but it will shrink and human contribution will need to be top notch",
    "Yes just had a screen call from AI I was shocked and my brain couldn't process as I didn't feel the human connection.",
    "Meet \"Bain,\" he will be on the team for the next quarter until the acquisition is complete. He cannot be in the same room with \"McKinsey\" or they bicker in their own type of Latin. They keep upgrading and adapting. I envision A C-Suite Board and a Stock Symbol.",
    "Maybe for junior consultants it’s difficult to match against experienced competitors who utilize AI aligned with deep expertise.",
    "Absolutely not. It’s 2025 now and I am a partner at a Big 4 firm and AI is keeping us busier than ever.",
    "Can you please make a video on impact of Supply Chain Products Domain in consulting industry",
    "Yoy seems hate consulting companies. Have you been fired by them? Don' spread anxiety and fear, ai is also helping them become better and stronger",
    "Please help us doing videos in which we can use Ai or train ourselves to have a better future without fearing about ai",
    "I was dreaming of becoming a consultant, then this AI come now im scared",
    "considering AI transformation, which type of companies are in good position for now as well as in future. Is it a consulting companies like MBB and Big4 or IT service companies like TCS, IBM, Infosys, Accenture. The point you mentioned that, consulting companies are now started giving solutions as well as support to that solutions. IT service companies also do exact same thing. So what will be key factors which will make this 2 groups of companies to take an edge over other.",
    "Nice insights. In my opinion, consulting is going to evolve. The client expectations are going to evolve from only solutions convincing, to guided implementation of driving results and how deglobalization is shaping that going to drive consulting industry.",
    "I FEEL CONSULTING WILL DIMINISH GREATLY AND THEY WILL NEED TO DOWNSIZE THEIR WORKFORCE AND SPECIALIZE MORE IF THEY WANT TO SURVIVE",
    "Hi Pavan Good video. Thankyou. Just want to know with present situation where AI is replacing many operations at work, is it worth to pursue MBA in Consulting at INSEAD?? Is INSEAD providing job placements for its Mba students?",
    "I do not Agree. As a Data Analyst Cant be replaced by Ai, So does a Consultant cant be. AI is an assistant. AI is not a Job Killer. We must refrain from spreading Panic. There are many aspects of Consultancy that AI cannot have access to. There are Privacy and legal Nomenclatures that Companies follow. AI cannot have access, nor can it provide a decision based on a few insights. AI can Help us answer questions.",
    "AI is just a buzz word and can never replace sap consultant. SAP me ghuso life set hai",
    "so what do you think doing a general MBA and getting into general management consulting or doing specialised MBA like healthcare and getting into specialised consulting is beneficial after AI?",
    "Even if AI arrives, companies will need IT consulting to implement and support them.",
    "Pavan I work at wipro...but within wipro I work for a product company that was acquired by wipro. Its essentially business platform for cpg companies. Since the business enjoys trust built over many years and a large international customer base, and is also continuing to iterate and improve the solution, would I be right in thinking that I'm in a rather better position compared to the rest of the IT business?"
