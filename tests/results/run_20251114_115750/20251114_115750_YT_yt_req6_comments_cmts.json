    "Corporations move at a snail’s pace. That makes it hard if you want to eat every day.",
    "I could have told you this. All the youtubers selling you on AI and other stuff as a business make it seem like finding clients is the easy bit. The product is the easy bit. The sales process is where reality sets in. It's actually all that matters. The product is less than 1% of the equation.",
    "Good luck Shaw! You're a talented YouTuber with a gift for clear communication. I know you'll do well!",
    "Congratulations, man! I tried a \"solo career\" twice, and I had to come back to my job (SAP BW senior analyst). It's not easy. You are an intelligent guy, and you will find a new ways to apply your entrepreneurship. The Force be with you!",
    "Great advice Shaw. On a similar journey and been realising some similar things",
    "Super authentic and relatable. Thank you for being yourself and sharing with us!",
    "Hey Shaw, thanks a lot for your advice! I'm in the same place you were 9 months ago, and I can totally relate to most of the issues you faced (like those discovery calls that seem promising but end up going nowhere...). I agree with you about AI projects - sometimes clients just aren't ready for that shift yet, especially with all the uncertainty and testing phases involved, as you explained so well. You're absolutely right, when something works, we gotta try to make the most of it! I'm definitely going to give this approach some serious thought :)",
    "Thanks, Shaw! I appreciate you sharing your expertise & experience. Your communication style makes complex topics easy to grasp. Keep up the great work!",
    "You go man! I really like your explanations of building AI pipelines with assistants and RAG systems. As an AI Lead in a tech company, you have helped me! Thank you!",
    "So much honesty and so valuable advice from this video! I can’t believe it people missed this one out! Big thank you for the sharing!",
    "Brilliant video... proof high intelligence, clarity, honesty and humility... you shall be super successful, Shawn!",
    "Thanks for everything I learned thanks to your video that I have been binge-watching on the treadmill at the gym :) You are extremely good at explaining complex content to anyone. Good luck man ;)",
    "Thanks for sharing, i experienced a similar story... data engineer that quit job in 2023 to figure out my own path with AI. I tried consulting, but my heart wasn't in it, and it showed in all sorts of ways. I am now building start-ups, finding my 'product-founder fit' and I consistently surprise myself with my level of creativity, grit, friendships, confidence, etc. I'm not making money, it's not glamorous and it doesn't 'feel' good, but I am meeting helpful people, learning and making genuine progress. I love you content Shaw, well done!",
    "Just found the channel and am bingeing on the ML and LLM info. Thank you very much. I hope this comment helps with the algorithm!",
    "You learned some very valuable lessons early on in your career. Be thankful and now keep doing what you enjoy most."
