    "As a consultant, I've been sharing/thinking about the points and fears you mentioned. Hearing I'm not the only one helps with my own sanity... thank you",
    "Wow, this is SO relevant rn! AI is flipping the game in consulting",
    "Needed this reminder to let go of guilt… feels so freeing. Thank u",
    "Love the conversation. Serious question - is this video AI generated using clones?",
    "Very amazing talk, a question to Alex, as a managerial CEO I think you will write a book to show how to transform the business model of consultant company by introducing AI ?",
    "In regards to the comment about our schools „ not teaching to receive feedback and resolve conflict „- this is exactly what schools have been doing since the dawn of times. This is what an education in a school ( not on zoom or with an AI) with classmates ( not robots ) and with a teacher ( a human, not an AI ) does. You learn how to function in a society, but you fo it naturally, progressively.How do you picture this „ better „ way to teach kids about emptions? Sit them in front of the screen and show them a video about emotions? No, that would never work, Humans( like all living creatures) learn by observation, Imitation and interaction . Sure, it’s good to have more psychology classes at schools ( and they do exist and the schools do talk about feeling and emotions), but it is up to the families as well. It is a parent‘d job just as much if not more than the school‘s to teach kids emotional intelligence.",
    "Feels like AI will kill some jobs but create so many new opportunities too. Thoughts?",
    "OK, I listened to this for 30 minutes. I’ve been in consulting 30 years last big Company was Capgemini. All these speakers are content generators. They’re not boots on the ground consultants. This is all hypothetical and overly optimistic Feels like pandering to potential book readers or corporate America Audience is not consultant"
