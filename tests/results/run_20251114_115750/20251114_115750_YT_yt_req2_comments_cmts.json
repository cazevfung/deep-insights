    "I’ve done the course. And weirdly enough, your summary helped me understand it better than the actual Google instructors. Bravo.",
    "For decades I have said \"if Google teaches us anything, it's that answers are a dime a dozen, but asking the right questions is where power comes from.\". I have similar feeling about AI interactions - \"If you don't know what you want, you are probably not going to get it.\"",
    "The best way to retain information is to make sure you understand it first; if you do not, come back the next day and write the explanation down. If you did, come back the next day anyway and write the explanation down. then 3 Days later, then a week later and try/make-believe teaching it to somebody. Come back 5 days after that. 10 days, 17 days and 21 days. You most likely will never forget it. It actually applies to even large amounts of knowledge.",

    "These kind of videos are a bit challenging to take in all in one go. It is absolutely worth rewatching a few times in addition to the quiz to have the whole thing synced in.",
    "Good prompt engineering can make a big difference. Too often, I see people giving very general instructions to the LLM and expect it to read the user's mind. Prompt are definitely easier than code, but they still require some degree of specificity. Good video!",
    "I can imagine a case where I spent 5 minutes to write the perfect prompt instead of writing a 2 minute email.",
    "Different AIs required different prompts, they all seem to have personalities and I have multiple of each one, and I found that especially with chat GPT between the accounts they evolve with you and their personalities change and you have to have different types of prompting to get the best results from them. I also found that they really like treats, their favorite is new information they don't yet have, if you can at the beginning of each chat give them a file or information that they didn't know, they will do far more detailed enthusiastic work for you than they would have if you just dove straight into a prompt. Also you can just blabber whatever you want and then end it with, can you dissect the whole text above and extract the key points and tell me what you think the best prompt for this would be, and it will pretty much do that and give you an amazing prompt, then copy paste that prompt in and watch it go",
    "@10:50 As stated, keep any identifiable information out of uploaded files or entered prompt data. Rule: If you can identify a person, business, attribute of a business, etc. in your data, you need to mask that information. For example, if you have store locations like TAR123, TAR456, and so on (could be how a well known retailer identifies stores and business can be determined by AI) replace the store location code with a generic ID. Like 1, 2, 3, and so on. Keep that cross-reference internal. Then, when you get the final AI enhanced file, you can replace the masked information with the real values. May seem obvious, but often times people forget. Also, make the uploaded file name generic, remove any keyword, property or metadata for the file, etc.",
    "Module 1: Crafting Prompts Like a Pro Learn the five-step T.C.R.E.I. framework: • Task: Clearly define what you want the AI to do • Context: Provide background or details to guide the AI • References: Give examples or templates • Evaluate: Review the output quality • Iterate: Refine until it’s just right A mnemonic like “Tiny Crabs Ride Enormous Iguanas” makes this easy to remember. Also covered are four iteration methods: • Add context, persona, or references • Break prompts into simpler sentences • Try different phrasing or analogous tasks • Introduce constraints for more targeted responses Module 2: Prompts for Everyday Tasks Use prompts for real world scenarios—writing emails, brainstorming, summarizing documents, or building tables. You apply the T.C.R.E.I. framework to make prompts more effective and relevant. Module 3: Data + Presentation Prompts Learn how to prompt AI for spreadsheets analysis or building presentation decks. Example: upload a sales data sheet and say, “Give me insights into relationships between customer count, inventory, and revenue.” The course also cautions against exposing sensitive data to AI. Module 4: Use AI as Creative or Expert Partner This module introduces advanced techniques: • Prompt chaining: feed outputs from one prompt into the next to build complexity • Chain of Thought (CoT): ask the AI to explain reasoning step by step • Tree of Thought (ToT): explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel Also introduces AI agent design: • Agent Sim: simulates scenarios (e.g. mock interviews) • Agent X: acts as an expert or consultant, giving feedback Set persona, context, conversation scope, and a stop word to finish. Bonus Tips & Responsible Use • Add personas to your prompts (“Act as an anime expert…”) for specificity and tone. • Specify output formats like tables or bullet points to guide structure. • Use multimodal inputs (text, images, video, code) when interacting with advanced tools like Gemini—but always specify modalities clearly. • Stay alert to hallucinations (incorrect AI answers) and biases. Always use a human in the loop to validate responses.",
    "Tina, this is exactly what I needed! You managed to condense 9 hours of Google's course into 20 minutes without losing ANY of the valuable content. Your teaching style is incredible! I'm obsessed with your mnemonics! 'Tiny crabs ride enormous iguanas' for TCREI is SO much better than Google's original one (which I also couldn't remember ). And 'Ramen saves tragic idiots' for the four iteration methods? Pure genius! These actually stick in my head. The way you broke down the progression from basic prompting to advanced techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought was perfect. I finally understand why my prompts sometimes feel scattered - I wasn't following the TCREI framework consistently. That AI agent section was incredible! I've seen other courses barely scratch the surface on agents, but your Agent Sim and Agent X examples with the jazz hands stop phrase had me cracking up while actually learning practical applications. The VP sports car pitch example is something I can immediately use for my freelance work. Your multimodal prompting examples (nail art social posts, recipe suggestions from fridge photos) opened my eyes to possibilities I hadn't even considered. And that responsible AI checklist? Already screenshotted for my prompt library. The meta prompting tip (using AI to help create prompts) is mind-blowing. Such a simple concept but I never thought to do that! Thanks for including that quiz at the end - the retention research point about immediately reviewing information really resonates. Already implemented your TCREI framework on three work projects today and the results are noticeably better. Your ex-Meta data scientist background really shows in how you structure complex information. This beats most paid AI courses I've taken! Already subscribed and checking out your Lonely Octopus program",
    "i like prompting outside the box uneducatedly so im a future enemy to A.I.",
    "I chose BeLikeNative. Because I struggle with prompts, and this is a no-prompt writing tool. The best part is that it does not generate run-of-the-mill content for me. Rather, it paraphrases and even translates the content at native level accuracy.",
    "Once she said ShangriLa frontier, Solo leveling and Naruto I instantly know I'm in good hands",
    "I am not particularly smart, but am I the only one who thinks that some of this prompt stuff is a little bit like common sense? Setting proper parameters, giving it proper context, clearly defining the task and output are just all things that I found myself doing naturally whenever I was unhappy with the output I received.",
    "Tiny crabs are grabbing a bucket of your drinking water so you can buy an anime gift. What a benefit to humanity.",
    "I'm in another Prompt Engineering course and kinda wish I'd found the Google one first. I'll finish the one I'm in now b/c I'm nearly finished but, man, it's been a grind (very technical/scientific). The Google course sounds a bit more interesting and useful.",
    "very concise and quick summary. one prompt technique that i use daily and did not see here was to mention a person instead of a persona. for example, if you are looking to get some marketing verbiage ask that it be written by Rory Sutherland. for company emails i will ask it to be written as Shakespeare but using modern words for the prose. you will get amazing results when you do this. i also will write a rough draft as opposed to just a prompt. for example, here is what happened when included the text above with this prompt: rewrite this short comments as if Shakespeare had written it, again using modern prose: A brief and nimble summary: One technique I use daily—and one not seen here—is to name a real person instead of a generic persona. For instance, if you seek marketing copy, request it be written in the voice of Rory Sutherland. For company emails, I ask that it be crafted in the style of Shakespeare, yet in modern language. The results are truly remarkable. I also provide a rough draft rather than a mere prompt to spark creativity. or you can get the more Shakespeare like text: Lo, a brief and nimble summation: One method I employ daily—yet found not here—is to name a true person rather than a mere persona. Should thou desire marketing verse, bid it be penned in the voice of Rory Sutherland. For company missives, I command it be wrought as if by Shakespeare, yet with the modern tongue of our age. Thou wilt reap wondrous results thereby. Moreover, I set forth a rough draft, not a mere prompt, to stir the creative fire.",
    "anyone looking to remember the framework - i put it best remembered acronym- RECIPT - REFERENCE- evaluate - context- persona - task",
    "Great job Tina. This is concise and well-presented It really focuses on teaching rather than just promoting the channel. The mnemonics are incredible and much more useful than those originally provided",
    "just a feedback. , at minute 20:00, the left and right pop up actually blocks your question.",
    "This is a fantastic and concise summary of Google's Prompting Essentials course. Your breakdown of the 5-step framework (TCREI) and the 4 iteration methods (RSTI) is incredibly clear. The \"Tiny Crabs\" and \"Ramen\" mnemonics are brilliant for making the concepts memorable. The explanation of advanced techniques like prompt chaining and AI agents was particularly insightful. Most importantly, it effectively highlights the iterative nature of prompting and the user's crucial role in the \"human-in-the-loop\" process to verify outputs and mitigate biases. Thanks for distilling a 9-hour course into such an engaging guide",
    "Google’s AI Prompt Engineering course is worth it if you’re new to prompting. I’ve used AI for a couple of years, taken courses, and read books [and even written books with AI help]. This course was the first to explain concepts like temperature, top-k, and top-p sampling. Also, I used what I learned in the presentation section along with ChatGPT to revise a presentation I'm delivering tonight (summarize and generate speaker notes instead of a manuscript). Will find out tonight how that goes. The course has some gems (and some fluff). Not sure we need people explaining how they use Google tools IRL. Maybe useful to someone. But feels like fluff. Could be wrong.",

    "Visual + Emotional Anchors - Create vivid mental images or silly associations—like picturing a giraffe doing math to remember a formula. - Tie facts to emotions, stories, or senses to make them “stickier.” Teach It - If you can explain it simply, you’ve mastered it. - Try teaching a concept out loud to yourself or a friend—even a pet will do. if you take information into small segments, and apply these methods, you'll be able to retain anything, remember Have fun doing it.",
    "I like this video the moment you said “So Ive also included a little assessment at the end of the video to help you remember everything that you learned”. Thanks girlie",
    "question answer: i only memorised the mnemonics and Couldnt answer the Questions but i am actively watching the video to re-answer the Questions. thanks Huang"
