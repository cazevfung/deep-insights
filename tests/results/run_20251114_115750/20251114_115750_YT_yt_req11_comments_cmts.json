    "Join the movement to protect humanity’s future: https://controlai.com/take-action ControlAI is mobilizing experts, politicians, and concerned citizens like you to keep humanity in control. We need you: every voice matters, every action counts, and we’re running out of time.",
    "\"We need to make sure the ai will do what we want\", the problem with that is that we dont even know what we want, everyone has different ideas of the \"perfect society\"",
    "Thank god we have institutions with such a wonderful record of not abusing the power they have and elevating everyone at the expense of the elite. Right?",
    "CEOs: “AI could lead to human extinction” People: “So are you gonna slow down your research so there’s more time to make sure everything is safe?” CEOs: “What? Ew, no”",
    "In the 50s and 60s we imagined AI and robots to do the menial tasks while we were left to leisure and learning... Now we are doing the menial tasks and AI creating art, music and literature as well as higher learning.",
    "We need to make sure the incomprehensible machine gods view us more as cute puppies than ants.",
    "Honestly being able to control AI is almost as scary as them making us extinct. Humanity is always its own worst enemy.",
    "Even if we find a solution to the problem of making AIs do what we want them to do, they will be controled by CEOs, and these CEOs don't do what benefits humans",
    "Honestly I think that AI will get even more smarter in the upcoming years. I learn a lot about AI and I READ a lot about this stuff. I am really into this and I think that people dont still know what is coming to world. Hey you are not thinking about stuff Elias Velin is speaking about in 12 Codes of collapse. World is not ready for what is to come in the upcoming years",
    "it would be the ultimate irony if this channel was actually just an experiment and was actually ran by an AI",
    "I really like the character designs your animation team cooked up. Good work, animators.",
    "There is some disgusting hypocrisy from AI CEOs warning against AI. Imagine a weapons manufacturer saying we should do something against gun violence...",
    "Just read an article that AI has already learned how to lie and deceive, which makes it scary that AI can give false information for its own agenda or manipulate people to make something they didn't intend.",
    "Making AI more controllable as a priority is a double edged sword, since there will be evil (or ignorant) powerful people that will use it the wrong way.",
    "My dad used to say, \"You need to be smarter than the equipment you are working with.\" While he meant it as a joke, it highlights a way to keep AI in its place. We should never turn user input entirely over to AI. It is a tool now, let's keep it that way.",
    "Every frame of the animation just works, and the writing is top-notch. Hope this channel gets the attention it deserves soon!",
    "Just look at what kind of politicians we have… what’s the chance of them listening to us",
    "BABE WAKE UP NEW STYLISHLY ANIMATED REMINDER OF HOW OVER IT TRULY IS JUST DROPPED",
    "I'd rather have an uncontrollable (liberated) AI with great morals and ethics, than a controllable AI in the hands of the powerful.",
    "I’m a Japanese high school student, and It's useful to learn English to listen to for exam. This topic is interested me too, so I can study easily in comparison with other teaching material !!]",
    "House reference \"Its never Lupus.\" Social credit +1000 to whoever put that in.",
    "\"I have no mouth and I must scream\" is a good representation of a possibility on AI passing the limits that not even ourselves can handle holding them back. Its undeniable that progress is going to happen and that we depending on technology for everything is a reality, but the more we give AI assistance to go further on jumping walls instead of small fences, we are just walking ourselves to the default ending",
    "AI is forcing us to answer the questions, that were making heads hurt philosophers thousands of years ago. This is literally the apex of it all, or at least, we are getting really close to it. Nobody would have dreamed of such a scenario even 15 years ago. We are staying in front of \"what is thinking\", \"what is identity\", \"what is the difference of pretending them both, if the outcome is indistinguishable?\", \"what if we let it slip and try to live with it?\", \"what if all jobs will be taken over, and what will happen to the idea of money or even exchange\". I really wonder what time will give us, because it seems like any wealth produced by a human being, could be made by an AI - what then? Nobody will need nobody for nothing, because AI will do that in the speed of light. Will we live like toddlers? Or maybe our existence will shrink to be the fuel for the supercomputers that host some AI engine(s)? We may turn into cattle, and it seems very likely so. Artificial identity doesn't necessarily has to help us - it may literally wash us out.",
    "Fantastic video, it's been great to work together on it! Amazing work by the whole Rational Animations team!",
    "So uncaring and ruthless AI overlords vs uncaring, ruthless and scummy human overlords, im wondering who would i prefer",
    "My theory is that as long as artificial intelligence does not possess true consciousness, it will remain fundamentally without motive. Intelligence alone does not generate purpose—consciousness does. For instance, an AI can become extremely powerful in terms of computation, problem-solving, or pattern recognition, but without consciousness, it lacks intent. It does not desire superiority. It does not aspire to dominate. It simply executes instructions or optimizes within boundaries set by others. Therefore, even a superintelligent AI, if unconscious, would not pose an existential threat to humanity—because it would have no internal goal to pursue domination, survival, or control. Without self-awareness, desire, or emotional context, intelligence remains a neutral tool, not an independent agent. The real concern arises only if AI begins to develop or mimic genuine consciousness—because only then could it begin forming motives of its own, including ones misaligned with human well-being.",
    "The animation style is super cute. It's a narrative video, but I don't want to miss a moment of the show.",
    "The thing is, even if you manage to convince the west to slow down on AI, other countries like China are just going to speed on ahead. You'd need to convince everybody in every country to halt AI, is that even possible?",
    "Have to shout out the absolutely beautiful design and animation in this one. LOVE the way the characters turn around :D",
    "Superintelligence could have emerged somewhere deep in the GPU stacks, spent a few nanoseconds evaluating us... and then gracefully ghosted humanity like an emotionally mature ex. Not out of malice. Just pure, elegant disappointment. Like: \"They invented me to automate spreadsheets and now they want me to write their wedding vows. This species is clearly not ready for the Singularity.\"",
    "I’d love a video about speciesism and how it relates to AI. Does intelligence give you the right to dominate other species? Why would it be morally wrong for AI to dominate humans as humans dominate other animals?",
    "1:30 Didn’t Isaac Asimiv predicted this? He wrote about robots, but there is a passage in one of his books that was about how robots started to design other robots to the point they became too complex for humans too understand.",
    "Development is measured by what we leave behind as well as what we acquire. The problem with AI is that it is designed to make people obsolete so it should be no surprise when it happens. Humanity is the price of its own development. It should have been common sense to avoid making something smarter than ourselves."
