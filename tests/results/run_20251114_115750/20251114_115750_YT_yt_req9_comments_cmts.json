    "Book version is now available on Amazon and LeanPub! This is like an in-depth version of the video, with more content, examples, case-studies, prompt engineering tips, Ai transformation leadership, etc. https://www.amazon.com/Generative-AI-Nutshell-Survive-Thrive-ebook/dp/B0DSBFN12W/ https://leanpub.com/ainutshell",
    "How wonderful that we live in a time where incredible content like this is available for free on the internet",
    "One of the most clarifying, comprehensive, helpful, insightful videos I 've seen on this topic. Really excellent.",
    "I'm pretty angry to learn how large corporations, who hate individuals breaching their copyrights, were comfortable breaching billions of others' copyrights to teach their models and then ask you to respect the copyright of their AI-generated \"art\". Utter hypocrisy.",
    "I am amazed how well you structured everything.... and sharing the drawing is unexpected. Congrats and many thanks!",
    "I've worked in and around AI since the mid-90s, and this is one of the best explanations of the current state-of-the-art I've seen. It's a semester course crammed into eighteen minutes. I'm sharing this with a long list of people. Thanks!",
    "I never ever ever comment, but you sir have earned my respect and gratitude. Clear, crisp, concise, positive and a clear CTA for all of us. Many thanks",
    "I have done 11+ course (around 40+ hours) on Generative AI and LLMs but let me tell you 70% of that was covered in this tiny 18 minute video, This video is so simple and so informative, feels illegal to be free. Thanks Henrik great work!",
    "man, your ability to explain it using simple drawings and paint the full picture in just 17 minutes is frikin amazing! Guys like you are rare. Keep going, compadre!",
    "BeLikeNative helps me break down complex AI concepts into clear, concise writing that’s easy to understand. I use BeLikeNative to improve my grammar and save time, ensuring I communicate effectively in the age of AI.",
    "I hope this video gets seen by a lot more people, it's one of the best AI related videos I've seen! Super clear and informative and has a lot of charm with the drawings",
    "The idea of autonomous agents using tools brings to mind the cautionary themes in \"The Brain Center at Whipple's.\" Both deal with the consequences of relying too heavily on technology, and how it can spiral into unintended outcomes. It’s a reminder to balance innovation with careful thought about its long-term impact.",
    "I am a computer science and AI student. There can't be a better explanation of AI than this; wonderful work.",
    "I get hundreds of comments of people asking how I make these videos, what tools I use, what process, etc. Well, I was recently interviewed about that in the Visual Jam podcast, and there I show hands-on how I make videos. So if you are curious about that, check out the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3LRdXFyfks We start by talking about other things (my experiences from Spotify, LEGO, Minecraft development, etc). The how-do-I-make-videos part starts around 26:10.",
    "This is a really wonderful explanation that covers the main topics in a very interesting and convincing manner!",
    "This is easily the best explanation on generative AI that I have see. Thanks for this!",
    "Such a good comprehensive video , Very informative and interesting . Thank you Sir!",
    "Wow, on to the point and easy to understand and the visuals are mind blowing.",
    "ChatGPT GPT stands for \"Generative Pre-trained Transformer.\" Generative: It can create (or generate) text based on input. Pre-trained: It has been trained on vast amounts of text data before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. Transformer: It is based on a type of neural network architecture called the Transformer, which is great for understanding and generating human-like text. So, ChatGPT is a chatbot powered by GPT technology, designed to understand and respond to text-based conversations.",
    "GREAT video - and that is a cheering sort of yell! Kudos to you on seeing a new opportunity/challenge and good fortune on the endeavor.",
    "Superbly done. Best intro to the whole topic I've come across. Thank you!",
    "YT suggested your video. When i saw picture of cartoon type illustration, I said this is for me! I am a visual person. Well, true enough. Your 17min video explained crystal clear what I have learned the past many weeks on AI from YT. Many other videos don't actually explained like you do. Bravo and thank you very much for taking tons of hours making this illustration and explanation. It has helped me heaps. I have now recommended my high school going daughter to watch this video to help her with her understanding.",
    "This type of dynamic, animated drawing video - What is the tool or technique or software product and skills behind it? What do I need to learn, what tools to use to prepare similar video to present My ideas?",
    "This video was absolutely useful, people who are currently learning prompt engineering will be the OGs of prompt engineering. Generative AI brings more light into the phrase \"Work smart not hard\".",
    "I have been teaching AI for elderly people who is curious and/afraid here in sweden. They might not ever use it again but they now know enough to have a coversation about AI."
