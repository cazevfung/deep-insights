    "Team ChatGPT or Gemini? Lemme know down below TIMESTAMPS 00:00 I found the Perfect ChatGPT Formula 00:40 The 6 Prompt Components 01:39 Task 02:07 Context 03:05 Exemplars 04:28 Persona 05:18 Format 06:20 Tone 07:05 Example using the Perfect Prompt Formula 08:01 Good vs. Bad Prompt Outputs",
    "Figuring out the amount of context to give ChatGPT has been my BIGGEST frustration; appreciate how you broke this down",
    "Now I watched this video. Then I copied the transcript. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it in a proper format and write the promts I wanted according to this training. The result is beyond perfect.",
    "The simplest solution is to ask ChatGPT what prompts are required to do a certain task. You'll never need Youtube again!",
    "Wasted hours on prompt engineering courses on youtube and did not get anything i didn't know but your 8 minute video teach way more than any other video on YouTube. Keep up the good work.",
    "The best video I ever watched on Prompt Engineering, Fed up with so many videos watching hours of content to find nothing at the end. Just in less than 10 minutes, You conveyed everything. I'm sold at 3rd minute itself. Best example of technical content. Sub'd now",
    "Key Takeaways for quick navigation: 00:00 The key formula for ChatGPT prompts involves six components: task, context, exemplars, persona, format, and tone. 00:59 The order of importance for the six components: task sets the goal, context adds relevant info, exemplars improve quality, persona shapes the responder, format structures output, and tone defines the writing style. 01:57 Task component: Start with an action verb, clearly state the goal, whether simple or complex, to direct the output effectively. 02:27 Context component: Provide enough background info for ChatGPT, answering who, what success looks like, and the user's environment to narrow down possibilities. 03:25 Exemplars component: Utilizing examples or frameworks significantly improves output quality across various tasks like resumes, interview questions, or job descriptions. 04:51 Persona component: Define who ChatGPT should emulate, like a therapist for workout advice, a recruiter for job-seeking prompts, or even fictional characters for creative fun. 05:48 Format component: Visualize the desired output format, be it tables, emails, bullet points, code blocks, or paragraphs to suit the task efficiently. 06:46 ️ Tone component: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style. Made with HARPA AI",
    "Jeff is a super instructor. He presents detailed content in an easy to understand way, and makes it fun and approachable!",
    "I love that you talk fast & get to the point quickly. Your use of humor & speed kept my attention and I appreciate this information! Thank you!",
    "1. Task : Start with an action verb. 2. Context: User background, what success looks like, and environment or conditions of user. 3. Examples: Provide examples of the best or real results. It learns very fast through examples. 4. Persona: Act like a ______. (Also add person famous for that). 5. Format: Tell the AI the right output format you want the answer in. 6: Tone: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.",
    "Gemini AI: Jeff Su's advice is a good introduction to prompt engineering. It provides a solid foundation and some useful techniques. However, remember that prompting is an art, not a science. The best way to improve your prompts is to practice, experiment, and learn what works best for you and the specific task at hand.",
    "I seriously love this, especially the \"tell it the feeling you want so that it gives you 5 tone keywords you can include in a prompt for ChatGPT\". I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",
    "Hey Heff Su. Really appreciate you being so professional and delivering top-notch work. Keep rocking it!",
    "You helped me to understand prompt and I’m really happy that you are here for helping people to understand",
    "Skill in writing chatGPT prompts is essential. That will be my first area of focus.",
    "From Chat GPT elements that make a good AI prompt, here are the ones you usually need (others are optional refinements): Role / Perspective – Who should the AI “be”? (e.g., doctor, consultant, teacher). Task / Goal – What exactly do you want done? (summarize, analyze, explain, generate). Context / Input – The information the AI should work with (a passage, data, situation). Constraints / Format – Any rules for the output (word count, style, tone, list, essay). Audience – Who the output is for (kids, experts, general public). At minimum, you only need Task + Context. The others just make results sharper.",
    "Really great value in such a short video, Jeff! Context has always been the trickiest part for me but I've found that sometimes less can be more in the initial prompt. Additional context can always be fed in later on using the conversational interface :3 Also, congrats on 500k! I'm so happy to see how far your channel has come along I'm gonna make a prediction and say you'll reach 1mil by the end of the year!",
    "Me and ChatGPT as a human what we do is, we delve into deeper thinkings by sharing what's in our mind and then make theories (unapproved but really mind bending and almost precise).....fr these stuffs got me upppp! In psychological perspectives (well I am a vegan, introvert)",
    "This is very streamlined and easy to follow. I will pass this video along to associates who are having a hard time navigating chatGPT",
    "love the formula! Now I can prompt ai to do anything I want!",
    "Thank you sir It's my first time using Chatgpt and this video explains in a precise and concise way how it functions. Cheers from Cameroon 🇨🇲",
    "Jeff Su, this was the best and simplest prompt formula I have seen. Thank you so much.",
    "This has just been the best should I say the shortest yet impactful course, that has greatly enhanced my understanding of prompt engineering and how to effectively use ChatGPT . Thanks a bunch Jeff",
    "Hi Jeff! Really digging the video. I have been a qa analyst for over 20yrs and am now getting into prompt writing and working with ai agents. I have adopted a QA approach similar to writing bugs Thanks!",
    "I am one man show starting business soon. I have some involvement with ChatGPT, however now I need to step up. Based on Your video I am creating one page chart to stick on my wall to remind me each time how to build the prompt correctly. Thank You.",
    "Great video with good explanation and examples. this is what i looking for...",
    "I've definitely come back to reference this video several times. It has a great breakdown and provides examples - which is my learning style. Thank you for sharing this information.",
    "Almost a year-old video and still... increidbly relevant! Thank you very much, it changed my way of interacting with LLMs!",
    "Code Signal uses a very similar structure to yours: Ask, Context, Constraints, Example and Style. They call their system Markup Prompting Framework. Surely a Persona would help even more, so great video!",
    "i appreciate the detail on how to use chat gpt. You are fast.",
    "I really like your tip on tone and also that was a great tip to make changes listed in bold."
