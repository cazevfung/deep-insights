    "Embark showed all other studios that it is possible to make an OPTIMIZED game on UE5 with destruction.",
    "arc raiders is the first big game in a looong time where im actively looking forward to it release. idk why but arc raiders during the server slam sunk its claws in to me and i am just looking forward to jumping in again",
    "As a concept, extraction shooters with permanent gear loss are great game mode for tension and replayability. It similar to a battle royale, but killing everybody else isn't the only way to win, you can loot something good, extract without killing anyone and thats a way to win.",
    "Arc Raiders will become the first mainstream extraction shooter. It's on consoles, plays well on controller, its third person which appeals to wide audience, and its systems are more friendly and easier to understand then something like Tarkov.",
    "1. Where did Mat Piscatella get that data? Is it NA and EU market data, or does it include the Asian market? Because that’s one of the most surprising claims I’ve heard. 2. Focusing on PVE players can be risky, focusing mainly on casual players is also a big risk because casual audiences often move on quickly. That’s why it’s important to invest in your core, dedicated players. A recent game that make this mistake is Dune: Awakening. 3. I also talked about this in more detail, discussing how the game could be more engaging and comparing Arc Raiders to The Cycle: Frontier a very similar game that did some things better but also made key mistakes. 4. Marathon feels like a less engaging version of The Cycle: Frontier. 5. Thanks for reading, and keep up the great work, GameSpot.",
    "I don't care if it's ANOTHER extraction shooter or ANOTHER battle royale as long as it's unique and good and has players !",
    "I hate the conversation about \"Why is Everybody making Extraction Shooters?\" when there is literally only a few games in the genre compared to LITERALLY EVERY OTHER GENRE. Why not ask \"Why is Everyone making Soulslikes?\", \"Why is Everyone making \"FPS Shooters\" , \"Why is everyone making battle royales?!\" I could go on and on, but the extraction shooter genre is the one that should not be talked about in this regard. I think its more of a distaste from gamers towards the genre then there being too many games in the genre.",
    "I knew Arc Raiders was a masterpiece after hours of play, but I didn’t realize that Embark was such a prodigy studio.",
    "why is there a narrative that theres like a market saturation of extraction shooters? its in every conversation about it -- oh everyones making it -- like i can barely name 5 of them, and not all of them have penetrated the mass market yet.",
    "Not a single extraction shooter yet has hit a massive mainstream success like several BRs did, so it kinda makes sense devs are trying to break it with their game",
    "There is not a decent extraction shooter on the consoles until Arc Radiers comes out.",
    "MWZ made me fall in love with the idea of an Extraction Shooter. I love Battle Royales AND Extraction shooters (I love Rebirth Island)",
    "Theres like 3 extraction shooters on the market right now. Where does the idea that this is a saturated market come from????",
    "I feel like because current interest is low. Publishers probably see it as untapped potential. They probably see it as an opportunity to make the 'fortnite' of extraction shooters because it doesn't already exist",
    "I’d rather them make more extraction shooter than campaign games that I’ll only get 6-10 hours out of it after beating the campaign.",
    "For one thing, you don't have to pay a writing team . Seriously though, I miss the days when games had both campaign and multiplayer modes. Arc Raiders has real potential for popularity in both.",
    "The MAIN REASONS is games take a LONG TIME TO MAKE. So when they started development on these games there weren't loads of Extraction shooters. They were hoping it was going to be the next big thing (like Bungie did)",
    "Sure hope they explore the more pve like gameplay. Maybe add incentives on some maps to help make people work together. Like huge bonus for 2 or more solos exfilling together. Was so jazzed when it was going to be a pve game! :( maybe as the studio grows they will add enough folks to be able to do a good pve game right. Five years later....",
    "Easiest answer is because it’s the final form for shooters that people WANT to play. You get PvP action with missions and loadouts where no 2 runs or matches are ever the same. Extraction shooters is where it’s at.",
    "I didn't know I was interested in extraction shooters until I actually played one. For me it was the perfect balance for a mp mode because of the variety and tension. Battle Royale is too focused on kills over everything else.",
    "A few probably will succeed. Tarkov being the established game will be fine and as of now it seems like Arc Raiders will be the first true mainstream hit. Overall extraction shooters seem to be like all the companies trying to make a battle royal after PUBG and Fortnite found incredible success except that all these companies are trying to be the first mainstream hit and the publishers are betting far too much on being that first breakthrough hit.",
    "Extraction Shooters has a fun concept but i feel like player engagement is always too high to the point it feels like a team based FPS. I wish these games would make a PVE option like a looter shooter",
    "I don't care what genre a game is as long as it's good. Every single genre can be executed well. What I'm tired of is the merry-go-round of player/industry bandwagon where people collectively decide that an entire kind of game is now good or bad, whether that be open world, linear, RPGs, action, battle royale, moba etc. Every single one of these genres is valid and has proven enjoyable in some form or another in the past.",
    "Every extraction shooter should have a mode that is just PvE. I dont play them because I hate having a good run then losing everything because of a player I didn't see.",
    "Everyone wants to be the next \"Fortnite\" of the next trending genre. Tarkov showed that their is deep pocket potential here so if it makes dollars.... it makes sense. Embark will be leading the console charge with Arc Raiders for sure.",
    "I for one will be doing as much as I can (within reason, I expect reasonable things from Embark for now) to make sure that Arc Raiders succeeds. It is not about it being an Extraction Shooter, for me. It is about being a UNIQUE and FRESH and GENUINELY ORIGINAL game. Same with The Finals. They deserve my money because they are some of the only people trying to push the boundaries of multiplayer experiences. I appreciate them immensely.",
    "I get why a smaller studio is working on extraction shooters and that does seem sustainable with that environment. My cynical thoughts for larger studios though is that they're probably see it as the new hotness and publishers want to be the one who drops the first main stream title in hopes of capturing that new fortnite lightning.",
    "I feel like Extractions, well... theres no \"big game\" yet, all of them are \"popular\" but not Fortnite, PUBG, WARZONE, DOTA, LOL, Valorant, level of popularity. My guess people are doing lots of extraction shooters BECAUSE they are trying to be THAT Big Game. The pioneer BIG Extraction Game. Tarkov, Arena Breakout Infinite, Delta Force, WArzone DMZ, Hunt Showdown, etc, none of those are THE BIG EXTRACTION GAME. But its easier to try to find this Big Game to explode in a genre where this game doesnt exist. Compared to doing a BR and having to compete with other four insanely popular ones, where players are alreayd invested in the game with tons of cosmetics. Same for MOBAs.",
    "2 games…just 2 are being made. There isn’t a huge flood of extraction shooters",
    "As I get older, and my time for gaming drops, I just can’t play games that depend on “grinding” I’ll play multiplayer games but I don’t expect to progress in them, because I’m just hanging with friends. But extraction shooters seem to give the “grinder” 2 edges that negatively impact my experience - those players play more (and therefore are better at the game) but they also have better gear than me.",
    "I feel like this video is a bit late, yet completely necessary. Studios are making Extraction Shooters without caring how much money it loses them. It is like the order of precedent is: Making an Extraction Shooter > Profit > Making Good Games."
