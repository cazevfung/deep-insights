    "Video got stuck in a loop for me at 0:08, it was was glorious, Luke saying \"hard\" for like 10 seconds. Gotta love yt glitches.",
    "Okay, so at least I know it isn’t just me that thinks YouTube is down",
    "I saw the thumbnail and just downloaded it to listen later at work. I really thought this was going to be about arcs raiders lol",
    "It's actually youtube new premium tier, you get ads for free but you gotta pay for every video.",
    "as someone not paid to play the game, unironically its pretty fun, it has so many ways of making money that dont require any gunplay skills that realistically speaking you are unlikely to ever run out of money and gear or no gear you can kill anyone in the game because armor doesnt cover legs and most of the arms depending on the armor, so you can just cripple someone and shoot their legs/arms until they die even if they have the highest tier armor genuinly worth trying imo",
    "If you loot a dead team mates body they get there loot back",
    "I’ve been playing this regularly lately… mil-sims are not my typical thing, but this game has a lot in it for a free2play title, its surprisingly polished and it’s holding me over while I wait for Arc Raiders.",
    "Just because of that spawn camp / bad spawn mechanics at the end I am discouraged to try this.",
    "Luke, at least have the decency to put the name of the game on the thumbnail or title instead of \"I tried it\" and \"I tried an extraction shooter...\"",
    "0:37 I'm really sold on this amazing gameplay. 4 mosin shots to this AI's thorax and he runs away like a fuckin gremlin",
    "What you experienced there at the end is called a spawn rush. Unfortunately with the maps being somewhat limited in size, it means if you know where players would typically spawn, they will rush you down. I don't like it but I don't know if theres anything that can be done about it",
    "I might actually give this extraction shooter a try. And since there have been so many recently can we just call them \"extracts\" now?",
    "16:23 I haven't seen anything drop in and die that fast since Radical Heights.",
    "I’ve been checking this game out on YouTube for a couple days now. I’m gonna try it tonight. I’ve been very wary of trying because im always a solo player, but hopefully it won’t be too bad.",
    "YouTube down. I immediately start freaking out. Ok at least my downloaded videos still play.",
    "Six year Tarkov vet here. I got Kappa once in 2021, but since, taken breaks and very casual. I still cannot find the same scratch Tarkov scratches, even alternative (solutions like Arena). The pain and suffering of Tarkov causes makes successes so satisfying, that other games feel so bland. It’s so strange. I lovely hate that feeling. Plus, this is a very straight forward copy paste. They do some things well or different, but so many things, feel copied. I can’t do that.",
    "0:38 What is this hit-detection? How didn't that guy die? 3 rounds to the face and one to the chest with a sniper.",
    "how is that is so just happens that you are always impressed when its sponsored video",
    "dosnt look like hes hitting the ennemies when he should in the video..",
    "To sum up the Arena Breakout Infinite: It's slightly more casual than Escape from Tarkov but it has kill am so you know you don't died from a cheater. Also have some QOL improvements making it easier for new players. And oh yes I play this game for a year and I met cheater only once. Their anticheat seems to be working.",
    "It’s funny. I always hear guys saying “I can say whatever I want”. Never once was that not followed with praise. Makes you think.",
    "its so good man, a breath of fresh air, i wish it was better advertised because it might be the best in the genre aside from hunt",
    "I'm loving ABI so far. Haven't paid a dime and have 20 hours of fun in!",
    "Can you play PVE only? I am not good enough at fps shooters to enjoy a PVP game but would love to try if the only enemies are AI",
    "Wow... Game devs... the ones always complaining they dont know what we want... THIS!! Great vid btw!",
    "lemme guess it's gonna be Arena Breakout, considering they sponsor every youtuber currently?",
    "So , F2p Escape from tarkov. okay ... i'm listening. Completely dropped tarkov after their version updates wich price hiked like crazy.",
    "Also as hardcore as this game is, cheaters were never a problem in any multiplayer game, especially in f2p ones. It's a fucking shame, sad sad people who have to cheat",
    "12:37 That comment made my decision to download just now, most of these extract-looters are pretty toxic.",
    "Arena breakout trying so hard to stay relevant after arc raiders open beta:",
    "Saw \"Tactical Extraction Shooter\" and got happy that YouTube is broken right now",
    "On the actual video topic...I never got the appeal of Extraction Shooters, what's the point of grinding for hours on upgrading and putting attachments on your gun just for you to lose it in one match because of a mistake, why male it such high stakes in every single match? Or do you not use the gun you upgraded? In that case what's the point of upgrading your guns??",
    "I thought this game's already come and gone. But hey get that bag.",
    "Ah yes, love me some spawn campers (aka pros), I'm happy there's a single player option! Thanks for the review",
    "what do yall mean by “youtube down”? i can still watch videos but they can be a bit “buffery” at times, is that what yall are referring to?",
    "I'll stick to Ready or Not and avoid the online requirements and get a much better experience of tactics. Not a bunch of people running everywhere shooting",
    "This game looks really good, the only problem is that it's an extraction shooter, which I just don't fuck with. The storm and fog being impactful is really cool as well. I would love to play a game like this, if it was more, Idk, Destiny style? (Minus all the issues and bad management ofc) Like, if there was a good PvE and separate PvP mode, with progression for unlocks or smth, just engage with the mechanics and enjoy a good gunplay and systems around it. Ugh, I hate that I love how it looks, but I know that I would not enjoy it and get bored really fast.",
    "\"...which just launched on Steam\" Wait, what? It's been a month since it has launched",
    "Ive been playing ABI since season 0 and it's a lot of fun. Not as complex at Tarkov but still in depth enough. So it's super satisfying to win a fight and get to loot. And the core mode is 4 people squads not trios",
    "I know you review new games, but I think it'd be cool to see you try out insurgency sandstorm, still a great game",
    "Glad to hear that this game is actually decent and ppl like it (as per steam reviews) (no I'm not glazing, I don't give a duck)",
    "I have seen this exact game so many times by all the big youtubers who got paid to play it and you are saying the same things as they were paid to say."
