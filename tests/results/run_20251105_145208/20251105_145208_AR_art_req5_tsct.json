  "content": "Context\nCodebase Indexing\nIndexing Your Codebase\nTo get better and more accurate codebase answers using @codebase\nor Ctrl/⌘ Enter\n, you can index your codebase. In the background, Cursor computes embedding vectors for each file in your codebase and uses these vectors to improve the accuracy of codebase answers.\nYour codebase index automatically stays in sync with the latest codebase changes.\nYou can check the status of your codebase indexing under Cursor Settings\n> Features\n> Codebase Indexing\n.\nAdvanced Settings\nBy default, Cursor indexes all files in your codebase.\nYou can also access more advanced options by expanding the Show Settings\nsection. Here, you can decide whether to enable automatic indexing for new repositories and configure which files Cursor should ignore during repository indexing, in addition to .gitignore settings.\nIf you have large content files in your project that AI absolutely doesn't need to read, ignoring these files can improve answer accuracy.\nAI Rules\nYou can add custom instructions for Cursor by modifying the Rules for AI\nsection under Cursor Settings\n> General\n> Rules for AI\n.\nThese custom instructions will be used for features like Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.\n.cursorrules\nFor project-specific instructions, you can include them in a .cursorrules\nfile in your project's root directory.\nLike the \"Rules for AI\" section, instructions in the .cursorrules\nfile will be used for features like Cursor Chat and Ctrl/⌘ K.\n@ Symbols\nBasic Usage\nIn Cursor's AI input boxes, such as Cmd K, Chat, or Terminal Cmd K, you can use @ symbols by typing @\n. A popup menu with suggestions will appear, which automatically filters based on your input to show only the most relevant suggestions.\nKeyboard Shortcuts\nYou can navigate through the suggestions list using the up/down arrow keys. You can select a suggestion by pressing Enter\n. If the suggestion is a category, like Files\n, the suggestions will be filtered to show only the most relevant items in that category.\nCmd K Keyboard Shortcuts\nYou can navigate through the selected Cmd K @ symbols list using up/down arrow keys, and use Enter\nto expand/collapse selected context items. For file references, you can use Ctrl/⌘ M\nto toggle the file reading strategy. Read more about file reading strategies here.\n@Files\n@Files\nIn AI input boxes like Cursor Chat and Cmd K, you can use @Files\nto reference entire files. Additionally, if you continue typing after @\n, you'll see your file search results after the @Code\nstrategy.\nTo ensure you're referencing the correct file, Cursor shows a preview of the file path. This is especially useful when you have multiple files with the same name in different folders.\nLong File References in Chat\nIn Cursor's chat, if the file content is too long, Cursor will break the file into smaller chunks and reorder them based on relevance to the query.\nCmd K Chunking Strategy\nFor Cmd K, Cursor also uses file references differently based on content length.\n- auto\n- Automatically selects one of three reading strategies based on file size\n- full file\n- The entire file is used as context.\n- outline\n- Cursor parses the file's outline and uses the information as context.\n- chunks\n- Cursor breaks the file into smaller chunks and selects the most relevant one.\nDrag and Drop\nYou can also drag and drop files from the main sidebar into Chat or Cmd K to add them as context.\n@Folders\nCurrently, @Folders\nis only supported in Cursor Chat.\n@Folders\nYou can also reference entire folders as context in Cursor. @Folders\nis particularly useful for long context chat where you want to provide the AI with a large amount of context.\n@Code\n@Code\nTo reference specific sections of code, you can use the @Code\nsymbol.\nCode Preview\nSimilar to the @Files\nsymbol, Cursor shows a preview of the code content so you can verify you're referencing the correct code.\nFrom Editor\nAnother way to add code snippets as context is to select the code you want to reference and click \"Add to Chat\" (Ctrl/⌘ Shift L\n) or \"Add to Edit\" (Ctrl/⌘ Shift K\n).\nThese actions will add the selected code snippet to the chat input box or the currently active Cmd K prompt bar.\nTo add the selected code to a new chat, you can press Ctrl/⌘ L\n.\n@Docs\n@Docs\nCursor comes with a set of third-party documentation that has been crawled, indexed, and is ready to use as context. You can access them using the @Docs\nsymbol.\nAdding Custom Documentation\nIf you want to crawl and index custom documentation that isn't already provided, you can do so through @Docs\n> Add new doc\n. After you paste the URL of the documentation you want, the following modal will appear:\nCursor will then index and learn the documentation, and you can use it as context just like other documentation. If you want to index all subpages and subdirectories, make sure to add a slash at the end of the URL.\nManaging Custom Documentation\nUnder Cursor Settings\n> Features\n> Docs\n, you'll see the documentation you've added. You can edit, delete, or add new documentation here.\n@Git\nCurrently, @Git\nis only supported in Cursor Chat.\n@Git\nIn Cursor's chat, you can use @Git\nto add git commits, diffs, or pull requests to your prompt.\nCommon Use Cases\nA common use case for @Git\nis to have Cursor's AI scan diffs and look for potential errors or issues that might be caused by the diff.\nYou can also use @Diff of Working State\nto generate commit messages from the current diff.\n@Codebase\n@Codebase\nWith @Codebase\n, Cursor Chat goes through these steps until it finds the most important code snippets to use.\n- Collect: Scans your codebase to find important files/code blocks\n- Reorder: Reorders context items based on relevance to the query\n- Reason: Thinks about the plan for using the context\n- Generate: Proposes a response\nAnother way to submit advanced codebase queries is to click the dropdown next to the Ctrl/⌘ + Enter\nbutton and select reranker\nfor the search behavior. This is only available when @Codebase\nis not used, otherwise @Codebase\ntakes precedence.\n@Web\n@Web\nWith @Web\n, Cursor constructs search queries based on your provided query and context, and searches the web to find relevant information as additional context.\nThis is useful for having Cursor find the latest information online, or having Cursor scrape multiple websites in seconds to find the best answer without users having to manually search anywhere.\n@Chat\nThis feature is currently only available for Cmd K.\n@Chat\nYou can use @Chat\nin Cmd K to add current chat messages as context. This is useful when you have an AI conversation that you want to apply to editing or generating code.\n@Definitions\nThis feature is currently only available for Cmd K.\n@Definitions\nThe @Definitions\nsymbol adds all nearby definitions to Cmd K as context.\nPasting Links\n@https://your-link.com\nTo have Cursor visit a link before responding, type @\nand then paste the link.\nRemoving Links\nBy default, we automatically parse links and convert them to @Links\nin Cursor Chat. If you prefer to have links as plain text, click the link and then click Unlink\n.\nIgnoring Files\nThe .cursorignore\nfile allows you to exclude files and directories from Cursor's codebase indexing\nAbout .cursorignore\nTo ignore files from codebase indexing, you can use a .cursorignore\nfile in your project's root directory. It works the same way as git's .gitignore\n.\n.cursorignore\nfollows .gitignore\n. If you already have a .gitignore\n, files are ignored by default. If you want to ignore additional files, you can add them to the .cursorignore\nfile.\nYou can read more about how this works on our security page.\nChat and Composer Context\nCurrently, Cursor Chat and Composer can access all files in their context without being affected by .cursorignore\nsettings.\nMore information about how we handle AI requests can be found on our security page.\n.cursorignore File Example\nIgnoring Specific Files\n# Ignore all files in the `dist` directory\ndist/\n# Ignore all `.log` files\n*.log\n# Ignore specific file `config.json`\nconfig.json",
