    "Team ChatGPT or Gemini? Lemme know down below TIMESTAMPS 00:00 I found the Perfect ChatGPT Formula 00:40 The 6 Prompt Components 01:39 Task 02:07 Context 03:05 Exemplars 04:28 Persona 05:18 Format 06:20 Tone 07:05 Example using the Perfect Prompt Formula 08:01 Good vs. Bad Prompt Outputs",
    "The simplest solution is to ask ChatGPT what prompts are required to do a certain task. You'll never need Youtube again!",
    "Figuring out the amount of context to give ChatGPT has been my BIGGEST frustration; appreciate how you broke this down",
    "Now I watched this video. Then I copied the transcript. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it in a proper format and write the promts I wanted according to this training. The result is beyond perfect.",
    "Wasted hours on prompt engineering courses on youtube and did not get anything i didn't know but your 8 minute video teach way more than any other video on YouTube. Keep up the good work.",
    "The best video I ever watched on Prompt Engineering, Fed up with so many videos watching hours of content to find nothing at the end. Just in less than 10 minutes, You conveyed everything. I'm sold at 3rd minute itself. Best example of technical content. Sub'd now",
    "1. Task : Start with an action verb. 2. Context: User background, what success looks like, and environment or conditions of user. 3. Examples: Provide examples of the best or real results. It learns very fast through examples. 4. Persona: Act like a ______. (Also add person famous for that). 5. Format: Tell the AI the right output format you want the answer in. 6: Tone: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.",
    "Jeff is a super instructor. He presents detailed content in an easy to understand way, and makes it fun and approachable!",
    "I love that you talk fast & get to the point quickly. Your use of humor & speed kept my attention and I appreciate this information! Thank you!",
    "Gemini AI: Jeff Su's advice is a good introduction to prompt engineering. It provides a solid foundation and some useful techniques. However, remember that prompting is an art, not a science. The best way to improve your prompts is to practice, experiment, and learn what works best for you and the specific task at hand.",
    "Hey Heff Su. Really appreciate you being so professional and delivering top-notch work. Keep rocking it!",
    "You helped me to understand prompt and I’m really happy that you are here for helping people to understand",
    "I seriously love this, especially the \"tell it the feeling you want so that it gives you 5 tone keywords you can include in a prompt for ChatGPT\". I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",
    "Skill in writing chatGPT prompts is essential. That will be my first area of focus.",
    "Jeff Su, this was the best and simplest prompt formula I have seen. Thank you so much.",
    "i made a chat in Chatgpt to transform my prompt into a much better prompt, then I just copy its response and paste it to another chat.",
    "Thank you sir It's my first time using Chatgpt and this video explains in a precise and concise way how it functions. Cheers from Cameroon 🇨🇲",
    "Key Takeaways for quick navigation: 00:00 The key formula for ChatGPT prompts involves six components: task, context, exemplars, persona, format, and tone. 00:59 The order of importance for the six components: task sets the goal, context adds relevant info, exemplars improve quality, persona shapes the responder, format structures output, and tone defines the writing style. 01:57 Task component: Start with an action verb, clearly state the goal, whether simple or complex, to direct the output effectively. 02:27 Context component: Provide enough background info for ChatGPT, answering who, what success looks like, and the user's environment to narrow down possibilities. 03:25 Exemplars component: Utilizing examples or frameworks significantly improves output quality across various tasks like resumes, interview questions, or job descriptions. 04:51 Persona component: Define who ChatGPT should emulate, like a therapist for workout advice, a recruiter for job-seeking prompts, or even fictional characters for creative fun. 05:48 Format component: Visualize the desired output format, be it tables, emails, bullet points, code blocks, or paragraphs to suit the task efficiently. 06:46 ️ Tone component: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style. Made with HARPA AI",
    "Almost a year-old video and still... increidbly relevant! Thank you very much, it changed my way of interacting with LLMs!",
    "This is very streamlined and easy to follow. I will pass this video along to associates who are having a hard time navigating chatGPT",
    "This is hands down the best channel about ai that i have found. Keep up the great work.",
    "Code Signal uses a very similar structure to yours: Ask, Context, Constraints, Example and Style. They call their system Markup Prompting Framework. Surely a Persona would help even more, so great video!",
    "Thanks a lot man. You made it easier for me to understand it. You gained a sub",
    "the most often component I use is hands-down TONE = friendly business tone!",
    "My advice to all parents is to ensure that your children receive a solid education from primary to high school. This foundational learning is essential for them to be able to effectively use tools like ChatGPT and other AI technologies in the future.",
    "I think one thing that has helped me (as a prompt engineer on the side) is a principle I learned while doing research in physics - set your boundary conditions. This is implicit in setting an environment, but I think worth stating explicitly. If you can tell GPT what the boundaries are on some context/environment X, then it'll give you an even better response.",
    "Kind of reminds me of the military of an OP Order. We use an acronym in the army called “SMESC” Situation Mission Execution Signal Command. It is a simplified structure for delivering operational orders, focusing on key details to ensure a clear plan for a military operations."
