    "her voice sounded way more natural than other in game AI's so far, really good",
    "2025 and not only do we still not have flying cars, we can't even smell Stella.",
    "This is the type of stuff I thought we would have in 2040",
    "Will they all say \"It's not just X, but Y\" in every single sentence?",
    "Lol what would have been interesting is if he said sniffing is how my people recognize distress calls",
    "she responded really well. it feels authentic and natural for a simple NPC in the game. I’m excited for the time when we'll have 3-4 npc AI companions joining us on adventures, traveling alongside, engaging in genuine, dynamic conversations with each other and us. add VR and online multiplayer and it will be totally next level open-world experience",
    "\"That's not how this works.\" If it were real life, it would be. You wouldn't be able to stop mustache. You would be a victim of the SNIFF.",
    "I saw this on the Neurosama stream. The technology is actually really impressive.",
    "\"If you get me back on Earth, and depending on your income, you might have a shot at a sniff. But only the end of my ponytail.\"",
    "Now the only thing it lacks is the feature which AIs play videogames in our place while we take a break and watching AIs playing videogames",
    "Imagine this technology in situations like negotiation and conversation segments in the Deus Ex series.",
    "that's so natural wtf but why he can't sniff Stella though, is it a bug",
    "Big fans of your channel - thanks so much for playing the game! btw Stella probably smells like space dust",
    "What if you tell her you're an alien who communicates effectively via sniffing?",
    "The problem with this is simply that it is extremely expensive to run large language models. So we will not get games that run locally and it is not a pay once type of deal. It is going to be costly to play games with an AI.",
    "i was thinking on a way for model control npc, like skyrim but at any game",
    "NO WAY. The video game industry hasn't invested in a long time. It thrives on recycling, it thrives on savings, it thrives on profit margins. This stuff is a thing, and you won't see it in games for another 20 years.",
    "I am not sure what LLM they are using, but for some models, if you reason enough, I am pretty sure it is gonna happen. Well, on the other hand, there are models no matter how you make sense, it rather die on Mars than follow your state of mind.",
    "large language models shouldn´t be used for this, would be more efficient and better for user experience any other kind of IA",
    "I would rather have a party of either all players or a mix of players and ai (still mostly players) rather than a party of ai.",
    "This sniffing around on you is pretty awful. The AI ​​is awesome, though.",
    "Oh boy oh no we are so caught oh my God we are roasted we are cooked we are deep fried and chicken batter oh my God well yes I'm going to have to save up a lot of money oh boy I am we are deep fried and turkey basted",
    "AMD is going to be left behind again if they don't manage to get in the AI race, if people can't run these things on their GPU why even have it?",
    "This game was garbage. It had exclusively linear solutions despite a supposedly dynamic AI. That's not revolutionary. It's countless steps back."
