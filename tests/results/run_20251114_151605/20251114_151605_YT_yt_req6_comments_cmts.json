    "Corporations move at a snail’s pace. That makes it hard if you want to eat every day.",
    "Good luck Shaw! You're a talented YouTuber with a gift for clear communication. I know you'll do well!",
    "Congratulations, man! I tried a \"solo career\" twice, and I had to come back to my job (SAP BW senior analyst). It's not easy. You are an intelligent guy, and you will find a new ways to apply your entrepreneurship. The Force be with you!",
    "I could have told you this. All the youtubers selling you on AI and other stuff as a business make it seem like finding clients is the easy bit. The product is the easy bit. The sales process is where reality sets in. It's actually all that matters. The product is less than 1% of the equation.",
    "Hey Shaw, thanks a lot for your advice! I'm in the same place you were 9 months ago, and I can totally relate to most of the issues you faced (like those discovery calls that seem promising but end up going nowhere...). I agree with you about AI projects - sometimes clients just aren't ready for that shift yet, especially with all the uncertainty and testing phases involved, as you explained so well. You're absolutely right, when something works, we gotta try to make the most of it! I'm definitely going to give this approach some serious thought :)",
    "I've been doing solo data engineering consulting for over 5 years now. I considered branching into AI (I have a theory and computation background in Comp Sci) but I decided not to in the end because of the reason you mention. For too many companies, it's still a nice to have right now. You are also dead on about all the other work, like lead generation, working new and old contacts, etc. Also, having a $60k contract pulled because the company went in a different direction suddenly sucks big time, but those are the ups and downs. Best of luck on your YouTube journey!",
    "You go man! I really like your explanations of building AI pipelines with assistants and RAG systems. As an AI Lead in a tech company, you have helped me! Thank you!",
    "So much honesty and so valuable advice from this video! I can’t believe it people missed this one out! Big thank you for the sharing!",
    "Thanks for everything I learned thanks to your video that I have been binge-watching on the treadmill at the gym :) You are extremely good at explaining complex content to anyone. Good luck man ;)",
    "Just found the channel and am bingeing on the ML and LLM info. Thank you very much. I hope this comment helps with the algorithm!",
    "Super authentic and relatable. Thank you for being yourself and sharing with us!",
    "Thanks for sharing, i experienced a similar story... data engineer that quit job in 2023 to figure out my own path with AI. I tried consulting, but my heart wasn't in it, and it showed in all sorts of ways. I am now building start-ups, finding my 'product-founder fit' and I consistently surprise myself with my level of creativity, grit, friendships, confidence, etc. I'm not making money, it's not glamorous and it doesn't 'feel' good, but I am meeting helpful people, learning and making genuine progress. I love you content Shaw, well done!",
    "Brilliant video... proof high intelligence, clarity, honesty and humility... you shall be super successful, Shawn!",
    "Great advice Shaw. On a similar journey and been realising some similar things",
    "Thanks, Shaw! I appreciate you sharing your expertise & experience. Your communication style makes complex topics easy to grasp. Keep up the great work!",
    "Hey Shaw, I’m loving your content so far. I just left my job doing data science/engineering for hardware development at a prominent AI / robotics lab, but I would have benefited from some of your latest uploads had I stayed. 1 video / week is typically antithetical to quality, but your angle is unique and adds value so I hope it doesn’t get too hard to keep quality high. Best of luck from Palo Alto, I’ll be following along! Especially for the AI content",
    "I love your videos. I wanted to say that one of the benefits of AI consulting for you would be to be involved in real life AI applications when you work with enterprises and start ups. Your educational role will feed into your consulting gigs and vice versa.",
    "Joined as a sub as I appreciate the honesty . I worked on my product idea for 4 years before finally throwing my resignation. Focus on the thing that matters and best of luck.",
    "You learned some very valuable lessons early on in your career. Be thankful and now keep doing what you enjoy most.",
    "Interesting, my favorite part is helping people with how great tech is. Consulting seems like an amazing way to do so but ill never be able to since i lack the technical background certifications.",
    "Love your channel, just to say you are very talented, quitting your job might seem like a bad idea at first, but you know in your heart, that job might pay well for now will lead you to nowhere what you can ultimately achieve in your life. Not easy to take ourselves out of our comfort zone. Keep on trying, it is far better off moving at a pace where you don't hang around waiting for others to finish their jobs, changing their minds/specs, picking up pieces that others don't bother finishing, wasting your time and effort, all for a monthly income. You know you deserve better than that, sky is the limit!",
    "Young people who want to strike out independently should be thinking about products and platforms, not consulting services. After 10+ years consulting, I'd say contacts are everything. You need to work AS a contractor for years, delivering well, and moving regularly to build a network of other good contractors. The consulting model is sell the service, staff it, making somebody you trust the engagement lead and keep an eye on progress, but also move on to finding the next client. The big firms make a lot of their profit from the margin they get \"bodyshopping\" talented younger staff not yet with a CV that would let them go solo. They pay them a third of what they charge for them. To get to that scale, you've got to have the cash flow to recruit permanent staff and pay them when they are \"benched\". It's a big step up, which is why the market is quite polarised between \"boutique\" firms and global corps.",
    "Great advice! AI is here to stay, so don't despair because businesses will need AI services. It's the future!"
