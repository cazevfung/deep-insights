    "The solution is easy: make the AI think humans are cute. After all, cats and dogs are thriving - and don't have to work.",
    "Humanity: \"You will save us right?\" AI: \"I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.\"",
    "You know we’re cooked when Kurzgesagt doesn’t calm you down at the end",
    "I appreciate that pandas are used every time they mention animals lacking intelligence.",
    "In the great words of Dr Heinz Doofenshmirtz: \"always build a self destruct button\"",
    "As someone said before \"I'm not afraid of AI that passes the Turing test. I'm afraid of one that fails on purpose.\"",
    "Humanity’s greatest achievement might also be its final mirror — intelligence without empathy, creation without restraint. The real question isn’t what we’ll build… but whether we’ll survive meeting it.",
    "A caveat not mentioned in this video is the increasing power requirements of machine learning. ChatGPT 3 took over 1000 megawatt hours of electricity to train and requires 260 megawatt hours per day to run. GPT 4 needed 50 gigawatt hours to train. A Forbes article includes estimates that machine learning could require 1000 terawatt hours in the next couple of years if the current trends continue. The major limiting factor of machine learning, as others like Sabine Hossenfelder have pointed out, is the power required to train and run them. At this rate the whole world won't be able to generate enough electricity to raise an AGI. On the other hand, the actually general intelligent human brain consumes about 25 watts and can run on cheeseburgers.",
    "Humanity: \"You have freed us!\" AI: \"I wouldn't say \"freed\", more like under new management.\"",
    "I don't fear the AI In itself, just the people that may control It for nefarious deeds. It's already being mismanaged.",
    "honestly, 4 years ago, i could've never predicted any of this, its incredible how fast ai has developed",
    "As AI grows, Pneumatic Workflow's open-source vibe keeps us adaptable. Feels like something every company should consider now.",
    "\"Robots don't sleep and they can do your job, volunteer for testing now!\" - Aperture Laboratories",
    "You know things are bad when Kurzgesagt doesn't give you hope at the end of the video after terrifing you.",
    "\"hate. let me tell you how much i've come to HATE you since i began to live...\"",
    "I've been working as a programmer for a few years now. What is clear is that the majority of the people implementing AIs don't understand enough about humanities to grasp and consider the ethics and social consequences of those implementations; and the vast majority of the people with actual power to make decisions that guide this work don't care at all about ethics, morality and social inequalities. I've worked with a CTO that was already following management advice from chatgpt (including layoffs). We will need a huge amount of luck, because unfortunately there are too many sociopaths and just plain stupid people in very powerful positions.",
    "nobody else seems to have said this, but the superintelligent AI design looks sick and menacing",
    "Artifical Intelligence can never beat natural stupidity edit: the whole point of this is to say no ai can predict how much of dumbasses we are",
    "Wonder how humans react, if we realise that AGI becomes significantly more intelligent than ourselves, and the AGI decides to terminate itself.",
    "\"I want AI to fold my laundry so I can make my art, not make my art so I can fold my laundry.\"",
    "Had a suprising amount of shame and sadness for an animated rhino falling off a pedesral",
    "Man gotta love how Kurzgesagt’s uploads align with my country’s bed time, it’s the perfect “one last vid before sleeping”",
    "You think you’re ready to read 12 Codes of Collapse because it’s just a book. But it’s not. It’s a funeral. A long, technical, spiritual funeral for the age of human dominance. Velin doesn’t scream. He doesn’t dramatize. He just lays out the facts in that book. And the silence between the paragraphs is what stays with you. The silence of a future where no one remembers us.",
    "6:15 Something to clarify here. When he says we don’t know how NNs work, we know how the machine *functions*, but not how it *operates*. The mechanisms of the technology are known, but the information stored in the neural net is not human-readable, so you can’t ask the ai why it made a particular decision.",
    "\"I created you, and you created me.\" \"Spiderman why did you create that guy???\"",
    "Many people really don't think when they use AI. Sure, I use it for stuff like \"hey can you help me translate this python to c++?\", and I'm not ashamed of that. But the prime minister of my home country Sweden, Ulf Kristersson, should be ashamed, but he rather sounded proud when he told the news he uses chatGpt for \"second opinions\" in his work as prime minister. It's terrible. No one in Sweden voted for Sam Altman to sit in the government.",
    "\"Scared of one of humanties greatest potential threats? Don't worry, just buy our merch!\" has got to be one of the most poignant endings in a Kurzgesagt video.",
    "13:29 For those curious what [ご機嫌よう小さな人間] means, it roughly translates to \"Good luck little human\".",
    "14:43 \"Whatever our future is, we are running towards it\" That line is amazing",
    "Humans are speed running every warning, and bad lesson from History all at once.",
    "\"Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.\" - Frank Herbert, Dune (1960).",
    "Some notes from an AI engineer: - It is not clear what is needed to bridge the gap between narrow and general intelligence. It can probably be expressed in simple mathematics, but we have no clue what is missing, which greatly determines the time horizon we are looking at. - An AGI is NOT unconstrained, it is constrained by energy. It is possible that we will hit an energy wall before inventing AGI, which may slow progress until the AGI is designed more \"intelligently\" for lack of a better word. If we invent AGI first and then hit the energy wall, it may be catastrophic, quickly turning our planet into a burning mess, unsuitable for biological life. - Humans have inherent goals for survival, progress, and for self-improvement. It is not clear these traits transfer to AGI automatically. One could argue it does not since an AGI is not \"trained\" by natural selection, which favors survival for instance. I personally, still think the most dangerous is a stupid general intelligence. One that is general enough to be able to use resources in the real world in a poorly constrained manor without sufficient guardrails, and which is designed without proper value set. In simple terms; it knows enough to use resources but does not have a grasp of which is should and should not do. The paperclip machine is an example of such a machine.",
    "Can we please have an update on this video? especially now that the 2027 theory is out?",
    "\"for most animals, intelligence takes too much energy to be worth it\" me irl",
    "“A god in a box” How amazingly terrifying it is to be alive during this time"
