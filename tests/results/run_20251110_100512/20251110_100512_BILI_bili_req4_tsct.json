  "content": "不知从什么时候开始，很多简单的事情都得换一个高级的说法，卖东西叫分销，挣钱叫变现，写文章叫内容输出，拉人进群叫私域引流，就连A爱写代码也得有个新词叫web coding。人们总是倾向用高级的词汇来掩盖内容的匮乏，今天我们来聊几个AI时代的流行词，提示词、提示词工程上下文，以及那个宣称可以把提示词工程踩在脚下摩擦的上下文工程。大圆模型刚出现的时候，主要就是一个聊天机器人，用户说你好，大语言模型可能会回复我很好，你呢？经过几年的发展，恩的能力已经远远的超过了普通的聊天机器人，但聊天依然是AI最核心也是最实用的功能之一。在聊天这个场景下，用户说的你好就叫做prompt，中文翻译过来就是提示词，所以提示词最基本的定义就是用户发给AI的话对于我很好。你呢？这种四平八稳的回答，虽然能满足大多数人在多数情况下的期望，但这也注定这种回答将会是干巴巴的，毫无特色的。所以即使只是聊天，也可以用上一些聊天技巧嘛。比如说我们可以用提示词给AI设定一个角色。举个例子，你跟他说你来扮演一个猫娘，接下来我说你好，这个时候A就可能回复我，很好，你呢？喵把这种玩法推向极致的一个软件叫做sil他们，为了保证这期视频不被和谐，这里我就不展开多说了，有兴趣的朋友可以自己去搜一下。但是问题来了，你扮演猫娘这种设定并不是用户。",
