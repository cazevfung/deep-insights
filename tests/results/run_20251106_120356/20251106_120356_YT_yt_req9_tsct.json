him I have heard he hangs out in the underground fight clubs on the city's East Side try there okay I'll go be careful Kai hey Mattel what's the location and objective of my next mission the next mission is located at the eye of misra players need to acquire the key and upload it to the main console since the mission requires faster delivery and upload of the key than the enemy having a highly maneuverable striker in your party would enhance your chances of success what should I consider when choosing a striker for this mission when choosing a striker for this Mission consider its Speed and Agility a fast and agile Striker would be ideal for this Mission which Striker fights the fastest the fastest Striker is the Falcon it features a high-speed Falcon form and can outperform other Strikers in terms of flight control and tactical flexibility I'd like to use the vcum for the mission sure Falcon is a capable Striker that can handle a variety of missions great I want to make sure I look good on the battlefield could you switch the paint to White Ang go let's go ahead and swap out the paint job for a brighter Style okay I'm ready for battle great just remember to keep your head
