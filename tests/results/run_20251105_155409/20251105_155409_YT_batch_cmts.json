      "content": "Great content sir! Just a summary: Whenever a record is read from the DB, the entire block is fetched which contains that particular record. Since block reads are expensive(takes more time to read) it is better to index the records based on the property you want to search. So now when you search the record it is first checked into the index table which is stored in quite a few blocks, so block read time will be very low. Since we know in which of the blocks, the exact record(which can be computed from index table using id attribute) is present, we can directly compute those blocks and return the record from them.",
