  "content": "Clash Royale was dead. Until a few months ago, everything changed. It gained attention. There were thousands of Tik Toks made and it became a social media hype. To understand how we got to this point, we need to look at the different eras of Clash Royale. Starting with the Golden Days. The game launched in 2016. The concept was simple. Build a deck of eight cards, destroy your opponent's towers, and defend your own. It was a very tactical, high-skll game. Every card placement and every elixir decision mattered. From the start, the game reached immediately a big crowd. YouTubers like Orange Juice and Surgical Goblin built entire channels around guys. Surgical Goblin here and this is my first commentary ever. In 2016, the game already counted 50 million downloads, but the real success was in 2017 with a total of 111.9 million downloads. 2017 was also the year that tournaments popped up and Supercell hosted official championships. takes it. Sergio wins. The first World Cup had a prize pool of $150,000. Crown Championship World Final. In short, Clash Royale was the most popular game. You could see it literally everywhere. Whether you were on the train, on the bus, or even in the classroom, everyone was playing. The game was truly everywhere. Supercell did an amazing job with its development. The characters were great and closely tied to their other hit game, Clash of Clans. There were also regular updates with new cards to keep the hype going. Clash Royale was at its peak. Even the story line of the game began to take shape. But then came the downfall. Suddenly, the number of downloads started dropping. Even as early as 2018, the hype slowed down and people began to criticize the game more and more. Complaints started piling up. The matchmaking felt unfair with players constantly being matched against opponents with much higher trophies. Updates became less frequent and when they did come they didn't feel big or gamechanging anymore. Another big reason for the decline came in 2019 when Brawl Stars exploded in popularity. I have some news. Brawl Stars is going global. Many players shifted to that game instead and Clash Royale started losing active users. Even though Brawl Stars and Clash Royale had different development teams, it felt like Supercell's main focus had shifted. The attention wasn't on Clash Royale anymore, and the player base felt it. The hype kept fading. In 2021, it looked like things might turn around. The release of Magic items brought many players back, and for a moment, there was hope. It's been 7 months since an update, and here's the entire update. A new peak seemed possible, but it didn't last long. Supercell tried to keep the game alive with big changes like Clan Wars 2, but those updates didn't really age well. According to many players, the main reason the game was dying was the growing sense of pay to win features like the pass royale, the removal of free chests, the introduction of level 14 and 15, and the new card evolutions. All of it started to feel like Supercell only cared about monetization. And with the recent removal of the season shock, frustration reached a boiling point. Players were genuinely angry. But how did Clash Royale become popular again? Even though the game seemed completely dead, something unexpected happened over the last few months, especially between April and June. There was a massive spike in players, and one man played a huge role in that revival. Jinxy. Jinxy is currently one of the most popular streamers on Twitch and has a massive audience across all platforms. He's already known for bringing life back to games like Rainbow Six Siege with his chaotic energy and pro game. Don't challenge. Do not challenge. It looks like he did it again. This time with Clash Royale. We have to go back to April. It started as a joke. He booted up the mobile game on stream just to mess around, but when he saw how much his viewers were enjoying it, he kept playing it more and more. That bear in mind, I'm coming off of like, bro, I'm coming off of like a sort of a retirement. And the numbers didn't lie. His streams pulled huge views. He gained tons of attention. I hired a Clash Royale pro. Eventually, he even started playing with top pros like Riley and Mohamd. But the real key to the revival, the endless Tik Toks and YouTube shorts. Clips of Jinxy raging, trolling, or pulling off lucky wins blew up everywhere. Add to that pro gameplay highlights from players like Riley. And suddenly, Clash Royale was back on everyone's feed. People didn't just watch, they reinstalled the game. Supercell noticed the momentum and jumped on it. They started doing more with social media trends, engaging more with creators, and pushing updates again. Features like card evolutions, and the new merge tactics update helped fuel the hype even more. So, yes, Jinxy was definitely the spark that lit the fire lumberjack. But the full revival, that's thanks to multiple creators. Think of Kent, a longtime Clash YouTuber who never stopped uploading even when the game was at its lowest. And just cycle cards realistically. So, what's next? Clash Royale has hit a new peak, one we haven't seen in years. But how long will it last? Honestly, probably not forever. If the hype around creators fades again and Supercell doesn't keep the updates fresh, we might see another decline. But for now, Clash Royale is back and no one saw it coming.
