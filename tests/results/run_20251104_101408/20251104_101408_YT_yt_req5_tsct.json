  "content": "for the last few months Squad Busters has seemingly decreased its Revenue by 50% and it is the most closest to Boom Beach and their YouTube channel is also the most inactive next to Boom Beach which isn't a good sign for a game that was released just a few months ago at the beginning it was super hyped up and it seemed really promising and I thought it was a fun game so what could have caused Squad Busters to have such a drastic fall and is the game even savable well that is what we're going to be going over in this video so let's get right into it first of all we need to understand what this game is and how it fits with the other supercell games since that is very important at the core this is a battle royale Style game in which the goal is to stay alive and get as many gems as possible and the intended way to do this is by building up your squad which is full of characters from the other supercell games and when compared to the other supercell games Squad Busters fits in pretty well on one hand you have Heyday Clash of Clans and Boom Beach which are like building games and then on the other hand you have Clash Royale brawl star and Squad Busters which are more player versus player oriented in which you have more control and there isn't as much of a building aspect so it seems like Squad Busters would fit right in with the supercell brand and it seemed like it should have done really well especially considering how similar it was to brawl Stars which is currently the best performing supercell game and one of the biggest mobile games games in the world in general however unlike brawl star Squad Busters really hasn't changed a lot and it feels like it has been the same game for the last few months which is what I believe has been the biggest problem and why it kind of fell off for the first few months the game only had one game mode which was gem hunt now in this the goal was to stay alive for as long as possible while trying to get as many gems as possible and whoever had the most gems at the end would win this was a pretty fun game mode and definitely was more unique than a simple last one standing style mode however there were two main problems first of all no matter how fun something is if it's the only thing you do then it can get tiring pretty fast and that is what really happened with the game as there was only that one single game mode and what helped contribute towards it getting boring was how The Meta went against the whole purpose of the game more people were just simply running around collecting gems solo and avoiding people instead of building up a squad and actually fighting and if I'm being honest that's how I mainly played the game since it was just easier to win that way however it did get boring pretty quickly and I know it's annoying for the rest of the players when you just run away at any sign of combat this is what I would say was the number one thing that led people to stop playing the game and unfortunately it may have been a little too late before supercell fixed this issue it wouldn't be until the middle of December that additional game modes would finally be added to the game but by this point I personally think a lot of people had just moved on from the game so the impact wasn't quite as big as it should have been since a lot of people didn't even see this update but this December update also did another good thing by making progression a bit more consistent by making it so you got a reward chest after every game assuming you placed at least in the top eight and higher placements will give you more upgrade Taps to give you a better chance at getting better loot plus there were also more rewards you could get and it overall was a good update for making progression better however like I had mentioned it may have come just too late as people may have just moved on from the game and earlier I mentioned how it was similar to brawl star and honestly I think that also played a factor in the downfall brawl star and Squad Busters are really similar to each other in the sense that they are third person shooters and they also do have really similar game modes both games also have different characters with different abilities and stats and overall it seems like brawl Stars was just a much more further along version of squad Busters I mean it had more characters and more game modes so personally I think people would have just decided they would continue with brawl stars as they were a lot further along when it came to progression and it was a game they were more familiar with the biggest differences I see is just with the art style and progression the art style is clearly a bit more 3D and higher quality for Squad Busters and with progression it has Evolutions while brawl star has things like Star powers and gadgets and just normal levels now there are different viewpoints on this because Squad Busters is a bit more simple and straightforward with the upgrades meanwhile in Brawl star you do have a lot more customizability for some people they prefer the complexity of brawl stars as it can make the game more interesting and less predictable while other people prefer it to be more simple like it is with Squad Busters but overall I do believe more people prefer there to be more stuff going on and that is why they would pick brawl star over Squad Busters but another reason as for why Squad Busters didn't perform as well is just because it was overhyped in my opinion now I think everyone can agree that it was surprising when the announcement came that Squad Busters would be going global because the game had only been brought back a few weeks before the announcement in comparison brawl star took about a year to get its Global launch and I think this was the biggest problem as supercell didn't give enough time for the community to feel out the game and provide feedback and instead it seemed like they had already made up their mind and potentially rushed the global launch I think if the game had gotten some more time in beta in which it could have received more updates and just more content in general then Squad Busters could actually be performing very well as it would have gone through the key phase of rapid changes that brawl Star had gotten that is really one of the things that made brawl star such a good game it constantly was updated and had features added and removed as supercell tested a bunch of different things to see what players liked and didn't like I mean the whole progression system has been changed a handful of times and it overall has just gotten better in my opinion this isn't something we saw with Squad Busters and that was a massive problem they tried to globally release a game that was honestly in just beta stages so when it was released it wasn't as special as it should have been and that made it a bit underwhelming in my opinion I think if the game was to be Global launched at the current stage it is in it would have performed a whole lot better as there is enough content to sustain a global audience I personally think supercell just rushed the game out for the sake of adding a new game since it had been over 5 years or something since the last game had gone Global which was brawl star they tried to really hype it up with Transformers collaboration as well which was good and definitely helped however there wasn't much to follow up after that they would have a fairly standard Halloween event but not much else other than the big Christmas update and if you look at their YouTube channel there isn't too much going on in there as well which makes it seem like not much is really going on with the game and it doesn't seem to have as strong of a community as the other supercell games on the other hand the Twitter page is fairly active with Daily Posts so you can say they are active through that and have a community there but I would say YouTube is a more important place for a community and should be more important for Content since that is where most fans are so overall Squad Busters hasn't been doing doing too well because they just took too long to add more content to the game and it was just too hyped up for what we would end up initially getting and that led to people just picking other games like brawl star over Squad Busters but this doesn't mean that the game itself is bad I mean it is still really fun and I do think it deserves a shot at making a comeback since it could be really big in order to do this I think supercell just really needs to go on a big marketing run where they make people aware of the change to the game like the new game modes so they are actually aware of what is going on since I feel like people just wouldn't know if you didn't tell them as they would have forgotten about the game this is a great game with a ton of potential but I think it just had a bad roll out that messed it up and it shows how important it is to set a solid foundation for a game before making it Global but let me know what you guys think about all of this and what you think supercell should do in order to try and revive Squad Busters but with that said said I really do hope you guys enjoyed this video and I'll catch you all in the next one",
