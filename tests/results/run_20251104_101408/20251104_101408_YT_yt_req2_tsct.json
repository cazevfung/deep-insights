  "content": "Welcome back, guys. Um, I'm not really too sure how to make this video. I thought I'd take the green screen down just to make it feel more kind of personal and real. Uh, but the title that you've read today is not clickbait at all. Yes, Squadbusters is ending development and the servers are going to be shutting down. So, straight up like Clash Mini, Everale, Heyday Pop, like any other Supercell game that you know they stop development, they kill the game. That's what's happening to Squadbusters. This isn't a joke. And I know this is a big thing just to announce out of nowhere. It's like like what class? But but it's real. So, I'm going to read the message that the developers are going to be sending to all of you guys uh as you're watching this video, and then I'm going to let you guys know about the mistakes I think they made, what they should have done, and then where do we go from here? Because, yeah, this is this is sad, guys. Anyways, so here it is. Uh this is the message that you'll see in game if you log on. Uh but I'll read it out. Squad busters development is ending. final update in December 2025. We launched Squadbusters in May of 2024, and we're delighted that millions of you jumped in right from the start. The excitement around the launch and the positive response made us believe the game had potential to stand alongside our biggest hits. At Supercell, we celebrate what we learned from our failures, and Squadbusters was an opportunity to apply some of those lessons, especially from previous games with long beta periods. We wanted to move faster, take bold risks, and learn directly from a global audience instead of waiting years in a limited release. What we learned was that we got it wrong. The game did not meet the high expectations that both you, our players, and we as Supercell have for our games. And by early 2025, we face a true crossroad. Either accept that Squad Busters might never grow into the kind of global phenomenon phenomenon uh that we dreamed of or take a big creative swing. We chose the latter. The introduction of Heroes was the boldest game change off the scale in Supercell's live game history. An attempt to redefine what Squadbusters could be. But despite the team's best efforts and your continued support, we were not able to find a lasting solution to its core problems. After months of reflection, we have made the extremely difficult decision to end active development of Squadbusters. There will be one final update in December of 2025, which will include part of the content we shared in our recent road map. After that, the game will remain available to download and play for a while longer. Although, we do expect to close it at some point in 2026, but not before the middle of the year. While this is not the outcome we hoped for, we believe it is the right decision to stay true to Supercell's goal of creating games that players can love for years. Squad Basters brought joy to many of us, but it did not reach the long-term quality bar we hold ourselves to. Making games that millions play and remember forever. The Squad team is made up of supremely talented developers. And by shifting the energy to both new games and our existing live games, we can continue improving the experience millions of players already love and ensure that every future Supercell game has the best possible chance to thrive. So, what's going to be happening now, guys? Well, inapp purchases are no longer going to be available from the time that you're watching this video. Uh, if you've made any purchases during 2025 at all, you'll be able to request a transfer of their value to another Supercell game, including Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, Heyday, or Boom Beach. The transfer window opens on November the 10th through player support, and will remain available until the end of 2025. To claim your transfer, be ready to provide the game name, your player name, and player tag from the game you want to transfer to. And then follow these steps. Open settings in Squadbusters. Tap more settings. Tap help and support. Tap the blue chat icon in the top right. Click leave a message button. Tap on transfer in-game currency and then follow the instructions. Additionally, as a thank you for your time, passion, and for being part of this project, you'll be able to claim free bundles through the Supercell Store for most of our other games. based on your total Squad busters play time. These bundles will be available starting November 10th and until the end of 2025. If you've never played Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, or Heyday, and you want to be allegible for the rewards, make sure to download the game and link your Supercell ID before November 10th. We're also bringing back the Squadbusters themed cosmetics that we that have remained exclusive since launch, giving you one last chance to claim them and take a piece of squad with you to Clash Royale, Brawl Stars, Clash of Clans, Haye, and Boom Beach. Now, we know this news brings questions and we want to address them openly. So, on November the 13th, we will we will share a written Q&A in game where we will dive deeper into this decision. You can submit your questions through this form and it's going to be a form linked to the post that you see if you log in game and we will do our best to include as many as possible. We're also exploring other ways to share the story of Squadbusters and its journey in the future. I this might be a bit of a Clash Mini in squad in Clash Royale scenario. I'm not sure. To everyone who played, supported, and believed in Squadbusters, thank you. Every meme, every squad, every chaotic match reminded us how lucky we have been to have such a passionate and creative community. We hope you continue your adventures in our other Supercell games and carry a piece of the squad spirit wherever you go. We are committed to learning from this experience and becoming better at what we do so that every future game we create has the best possible chance to be played for years and remembered forever. Squad busters will always be a part of Super Story. Thank you for being part of this journey with us, the Squad Busters team. So, wow. That Yeah. Um, for you guys, maybe you've been expecting this to come for a while, but this is a global game. This is not something that I feel like a lot of people expected, especially to happen right now, as in there's still an update planned that they're still killing the game off or announcing it now. It's um it's big. All right, so I've got the green screen back up. Feels a little bit more normalish. Um, so how do I feel? What's the future for Squadbusters? And uh, yeah, so mistakes that I think were made. Obviously, the game should probably have never gone global to be honest with you. It was not a global ready game. That I think is the biggest mistake we can all say. I will also say if this game never went go global, I would have never played it. The only reason I installed this game was cuz I heard new Supercell game, it's going global. Supercell, I have a feeling they have this um they are known to kill games when they're in beta. So, you should never Well, I never played them or never got attached to them. Never even played them because I was like, \"Hey, it's going to die.\" So, when Squad Busters was actually going global, I was like, \"Well, I'm going to play this.\" Made a couple videos on it. Enjoyed the game. So, it probably shouldn't have gone global, but if it didn't go global, I wouldn't be playing it. I wouldn't have my YouTube career. So, it's a mistake, but I I I like that they made that mistake, you know. Anyways, mistake number two was um going to 2.0. 2.0. know, let's be honest. Sort of made the game like Brawl Stars or more like Brawl Stars. Changed the game from what it really was. I did a Squadbusters stream yesterday, as you guys are watching this yesterday where I played Squad Busters for an hour. A lot of messages in my stream chat asking, \"Do you think the game's going to shut down?\" And I had to say, \"I don't know.\" But yeah. Um, and the only game mode I played was the 1.0 mode. I played Arcade Blitz. I played Hatchling Run for like 10, 15 minutes, got bored, and then I played uh the 1.0 mode. In fact, since the 1.0 0 mode has come out. That's the only mode I That's the only game I played. And I actually kind I like it. It's got heroes. It's like a bit of a mix. And I feel like what they should have done instead of 2.0 was just add a heroes mode. Why did we not come add if they added a heroes mode? Like they could have made the heroes update probably well anyone could have chose to play 1.0 or heroes and probably most people would have chosen 1.0. But obviously if they made a heroes mode, they probably wouldn't have been able to do that big rebrand to get a bunch of people back in the game. So yeah. So yeah, th those are the two the two mistakes. And also clans didn't come out. Like I can't believe this game has not released clans. Like to me, I was always confident squadbusters could sort of bounce back because I knew the game wasn't good. Not good, but it wasn't like ready, you know? It made sense to why the game wasn't doing well. It did not have clans, any social features at all. Piñatas, they don't count. And there was no good like you couldn't play with friends. Really? Duos is not We don't count duos, man. Like it made sense from that aspect. And also there wasn't frequent updates like Cash Royale, Crash Clans, Boom Beach, not Boom Beach. Oh, I think Boom Beach has it as well. I don't know, but Brawl Stars specifically every single month they've got a new troop, something new, you know, Cash Royale is a new troop, a new rework, new Evo, stuff like that. Like, we didn't have that. So, for us not to have that, it made sense. I was like, you know what? They'll release some big clans feature. They'll rework ladder and then all it's going to require is um some social features and then the game will come back. But it never made it to there. they decided to shut it down a little early in my opinion and that was the change they should have made instead of 2.0 I think. Anyways, you know, we could we could talk all day about the mistakes I think this game made. And I will have a follow-up video in a few days responding to your feedback and everything. Um, obviously at first I did not like 2.0. Uh, I remember if you guys were in that first stream I did when 2.0 came out, I was not very happy, but then I sort of got used to it and honestly I felt like 2.0 could have worked but it wasn't implemented right. Anyways, so let's go on to the future for the channel now. Okay, so obviously I'm a Squadbusters channel. I plan to stick with you guys till December. There's an update happening in December still. They're still releasing the musketeer and the 8bit hero. I plan to stick with you guys till December. I'll make a video on the new hero, the new squadies. And then I think that's going to be it for me. I think at that point that will be the end of my videos. And I will make a video before the game shuts down. I will maybe make a couple videos here and there. I might make a video on Kasha Clans and Clash Royale because I'm going to get all my, you know, gems transferred into those games. So, that could be a cool video. But this channel, I'm going to be honest, I think it's dead. I don't think it's ever going to reach 100k subs. If it does, I'll be I I'll take I'll take a I'll take uh you know, the plaque, that's what it's called. But I don't think it will. So, yeah, I'll stick with you guys till December. Uh if you guys don't know, I have another YouTube channel called It Class. It's where I make Among Us videos. Sometimes I make some videos on other games. Rarely, but most mostly Among Us. If you guys want to watch that channel, you can search it on YouTube. And I do plan to make potentially a Minecraft channel and then also a GTA 6 channel when GTA 6 comes out. My focus right now is very much I want to be a big uh I want to really, you know, like grow the class the cloudness, you know. So that that that those are my plans for the future. Anyways, that that's all I've got to say. I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all. A part of me is, I guess, relieved that I can now focus on my other channel and then future other channels. So, that part of me is relieved that I don't have to kind of focus on a game that, you know, was sort of dying. And I'm not going to participate in a hashtag save squad. Not because I don't care about the game, but because it's a waste of time. Clash Mini, man, they tried to save that game. They tried to save so many games that were in beta. And after being told how a game shuts down, like they gave us some information on, you know, all the steps that happens in order for them to shut down a game and they're not reversing it. That's just I'm just being real with you guys. I assume a lot of you are going to keep playing Squad Busters till maybe, you know, get shut down, but I assume a lot of you guys are probably just going to lose all motivation to play the game now and you'll stop playing it because, you know, it's going to shut down in 2026. And uh yeah, just want to say it's been great. So many memories winning a $15,000 tournament. Winning another $500 tournament, a $500 Squadbusters tournament. Winning another tournament like three in a row. 21 points. Second place with 78 points. 71 71 67 and then spending a lot of money on ultimates. I'm going to be spending over $7,000 on them. Anyways, enough of the ramble. If you want to subscribe, you can. But uh also, just before I end it, please be nice to the community managers and the devs. community managers. I'm telling you right now, they did not want the game to die. They were not happy as well. They told us that they weren't. They were very sad. Very sad. And I I believe them cuz um yeah. Anyways, bye guys.",
