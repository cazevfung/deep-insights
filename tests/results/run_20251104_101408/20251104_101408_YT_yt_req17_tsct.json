  "content": "In just the last year, Clash of Clans has changed so much with many big game-changing updates such as the most recent one that reworked the whole multiplayer attacking aspect of the game. And we have had many ups and downs. So today, I wanted to go and just get a broader view of the current state of the game to see how it is doing and what that means for the future. So let's get right into it. First off, we need to quickly talk about the major update that came out earlier this month. This is arguably the biggest update the game has gotten in the last few years and it completely changed how multiplayer works and I think this is going to define the next era of Clash of Clans. The update split multiplayer matchmaking into a battle mode and a ranked mode with battle mode being for casual farming and ranked being for competitive trophy pushing. And honestly, this is something that a lot of people have been asking for over the years because the old system just felt really inconsistent and it was hard to please everyone with one simplified matchmaking system. In battle mode, you can attack endlessly and farm resources without worrying about trophies, while ranked battles are limited daily attacks where trophies actually matter and you can't skip opponents. This separation is really important because it means casual players can just focus on farming without being forced into higher leagues and competitive players now have a more structured system that feels a lot more fair. Plus, the update also completely changed shields with a new magic shield system that protects your resources and doesn't reduce time when you attack, which is honestly such a quality of life improvement. But despite that, the reception to this update has been pretty mixed. Most player responses have been positive overall with people citing better loot protection and fair matchmaking. However, there are also a lot of complaints about the new league system and how the ranked battles work. Some people feel like the limited attacks and ranked mode make it harder to push trophies, while others think it's actually better because every attack matters more. And there's also been some confusion around how the magic shield works and when it activates. But I think that's just growing pains from such a massive change. Overall though, I do think this update is a step in the right direction and it shows that Supercell is actually listening to feedback and trying to improve the game for both casual and competitive players. Now, outside of this update, we also need to look at the overall health of the game in terms of player count and revenue because those are really good indicators of how well the game is actually doing. Clash of Clans has consistently maintained around 21.5 million monthly active players, which is still really impressive for a game that came out over 12 years ago. And when you look at the revenue numbers, the game is making between 24 to $30 million per month in 2025, which is obviously down from the peak years back in 2015 when it was making way more, but it's still a very solid number that shows the game is far from dead and it is still among the top three Supercell games. And I think it's really important to put these numbers into context because a lot of people like to say that Clash of Clans is dying or that it's not as popular as it used to be. But the reality is that very few mobile games can sustain this level of engagement after more than a decade. The game has earned billions of dollars since its release, making it one of the most profitable mobile games ever. And the fact that it's still pulling in tens of millions of dollars every single month just shows how strong the foundation of this game is. Obviously, it's not at the peak like it was in 2015, but that doesn't mean it's dying. It just means it has stabilized at a really healthy level. And it is important to note that it is doing better than it was a couple of years ago. So, the game is still growing. Another big factor we need to talk about is all the other updates we've gotten so far this year. Earlier in 2025, Supercell removed all training times for troops, spells, and siege machines, and also removed hero healing times with the Clash Anytime update. This was absolutely massive because it removed one of the biggest frictions in the game, and it meant you could literally attack whenever you wanted without having to wait. And this also changed how matchmaking worked because when you get a shield, a clone of your base enters matchmaking so attackers can still find bases, but the defender doesn't lose any trophies or resources, which just helped make that aspect of the game better. This update was really wellreceived by the community because it just made the game so much more accessible and less frustrating. And I think this update combined with the ranked battles update really shows that Supercell is focused on removing all the annoying parts of the game that prevent people from just having fun. And this really has been one of the most revolutionary things the game has done in a long time. And it has definitely helped make people play the game more because it is simply easier as they don't have to wait for troops to train in between attacks. And then we also saw the town hall weapon star upgrade system removed. So, instead of multiple upgrade tiers, each town hall now has a single clear upgrade level. This streamlined progression and made it less confusing for players. Plus, it meant faster progress overall, which is always a good thing. So, when you look at all these updates together, you can really see that 2025 has been a year focused on quality of life improvements and reducing friction in the game. Supercell has been removing all the annoying parts that made people frustrated, and they've been adding features that give players more freedom and more control over how they want to play. And I think this is a really smart strategy because it makes the game more accessible to new players while also keeping veteran players engaged. Now, another important thing to consider is how the game compares to where it was a few years ago. Because in my opinion, we are currently in the second prime of Clash of Clans. The first Prime was obviously back around 2015 when the game was making insane amounts of money and had a massive player base. But after that, it went into a bit of a decline for a few years. However, starting around late 2023 with the Mashup Madness event and then continuing into 2024 and now 2025, the game has really been on an upswing again with more engagement, more content, and just more buzz around the game in general. The player counts have been pretty stable and the revenue has been consistent. And more importantly, the community just feels more alive than it has in years. You can see this on social media with more content being created, more discussions happening, and just more excitement around updates and events. And I really do think that Supercell deserves a lot of credit for this because they've been putting in the work to keep the game fresh and interesting even after all these years. But we also need to talk about some of the challenges and criticisms the game is facing. One of the biggest complaints is still around hero equipment and how it's become kind of payto- win with people feeling like you need to spend money to max out your equipment in a reasonable amount of time. And there's also been some frustration around bugs and glitches that seem to be more common lately with some players feeling like Supercell isn't fixing issues as quickly as they should be. Plus, there are always going to be complaints about balance changes and certain troops or strategies being too strong or too weak. However, the situation has been getting better as the root riders aren't literally everywhere now. So, even in that case, it seems like the game has been getting better over the last few months. However, I do think the positives outweigh the negatives right now. The game is in a pretty healthy state overall with strong player numbers, consistent revenue, and a community that's actually engaged and excited about the future. The October update in particular feels like it could be a turning point that sets the game up for the next few years. Assuming Supercell continues to iterate and improve on the ranked system. Looking ahead, I think the future of Clash of Clans looks pretty bright. We're most likely going to get Town Hall 18 sometime in December following the new yearly release schedule. And I'm sure that will come with a bunch of new content, troops, defenses, and probably some other major features. And if Supercell continues on this path of removing friction and giving players more freedom and choice in how they play, then I think the game can continue to thrive for many more years. The Netflix animated series is also something to look out for since that could potentially bring in a whole new wave of players who aren't familiar with the game. And if it's done well, it could be similar to what Arcane did for League of Legends in terms of boosting the game's cultural relevance and bringing it back into the mainstream conversation. But with all of that said, I do think there are some things that Supercell needs to be careful about. The biggest one is making sure they don't make the game too complicated with all these new systems and features. The ranked battles update is already pretty complex with all the different leagues and battle modifiers and everything. So, they need to make sure that new players can still understand what's going on and not feel overwhelmed. And they also need to make sure they're balancing the game properly and not letting certain strategies or troops become too dominant because that can really kill the fun for a lot of people. Another thing to watch out for is the monetization aspect. Right now, the game feels pretty fair in terms of free-to-play versus pay to win, but there's always a risk of them pushing too hard on monetization and making it feel like you have to spend money to compete. And I think they need to be really careful about this because that's one of the main things that can turn people away from the game. And it normally is a downfall for games like these. Overall though, I'm pretty optimistic about the current state of Clash of Clans. The game has gone through a lot of change this year and it feels like it's in a really good spot right now. So to answer the question of what the current state of the game is, I would say it's very strong. Obviously, it's not at the peak levels of 2015, but it doesn't need to be. The game has found a really good equilibrium where it has a dedicated player base that's consistently engaged, and Supercell's actively working to improve the experience and keep things fresh. And with the upcoming Town Hall 18 update, I think 2026 is going to be another really good year for Clash of Clans. But let me know down below in the comments how you guys feel about the current state of the game. And with that, we are also at the end of the video. I really hope you all enjoyed and I'll catch you in the next",
