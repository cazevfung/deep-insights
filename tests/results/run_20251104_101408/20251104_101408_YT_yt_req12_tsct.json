  "content": "So today I'm going to be doing something slightly different. Nearly 1 month after the squad 2.0 update has dropped, I'm going to be telling you exactly how I feel today, how I felt when the update originally dropped and how I felt when I first found out about the update a little while ago now. So let's go back not too far back, but about a month ago when I first found out about the update. I saw Squad 2.0 on the dev build. And my original reaction, a lot like you guys, was uh firstly, wow, they've changed a lot. Secondly, ah crap, it was not what I wanted it to be. I was worried and I was upset. I logged into the game, I saw the heroes, I saw the three spell ability slots, I saw that squad sizes were limited, all the good modifiers were gone. And I just started thinking half the community are going to hate this and they're going to quit, which I mean a lot of you guys who are watching this video probably have quit. But unlike a lot of people who have quit and are very upset and want the game to get reverted, my opinions have since changed. Anyways, as we got closer to the update releasing, the devs did their thing. They balanced the game. They started to change some things around. And when 2.0 dropped, I was like, \"All right, I don't mind 2.0. I do prefer 1.0, but I don't mind 2.0. So, I went from hating it to not minding it. Anyway, so the update then dropped and we obviously got everybody's opinions. And I had very 50/50 thoughts of I don't mind it. And then sometimes it was I hate it. Right now, from a content perspective, uh the views were great, but there was a lot of negativity on the game, which I feel like did also skew my thought to not liking it because you were not liking it, a lot of you guys at least. But essentially, I would I would play the game against real players, and it was a lot different to playing against bots on the dev build. I would enjoy it, and then maybe like half an hour later, I would have some dumb moments where a guy would just throw a fireball on me. We all had this happen where like three guys would throw a fireball on you and you would just lose your entire squad. And it's like, where's the skill in that? You know, like before I could run away from someone, I had the speed to run away. Now I was just moving 2 mph while everyone was throwing fireballs on me. I was like, where where's the skill? Uh, but obviously Supercell did their balance changes. They made it so squatties have more health. They nerfed fireball. They nerfed B. They made some changes. And I would say at this point when they made those changes, I went from being very 50/50 about the game to finally liking the game and thinking it was better than 2.0. And essentially, this takes us to today where my opinions on the Squad Busters 2.0 is I prefer the game over 1.0. If they were to revert back to 1.0, I would be disappointed. I do actually genuinely prefer 2.0. Now, the most fun I've ever had playing this game still actually is September when the Transformers collab happened. That was the peak of the game for me. I don't know if that will get beaten again. It could get beaten in June. That's what I'm thinking. But, I mean, we'll just have to see. But, I am having a lot more fun playing the game now than I was the rest of this year. Now, yes, there are some elements about 1.0 that I like, and there are some things about 2.0 that I hate. For example, why does mortise throw out a tank with infinite health, you know, or why does the archer queen one tap my entire squad? Or why does it take 50,000 days to get a hero maxed out? But these are all things that will get cleaned out with due time and that they'll balance. So, the I'm not worried about them. Anyways, before I let you guys know what I want them to change and add to the game in the future, let's talk about numbers, cuz this is what matters. Are people enjoying the game? Are my views up? Are they down? Where are they? So, I can really only talk from my perspective here as a content creator, but let's go over this. So, I recently made a Reddit video where I went over the stats. And I'll link this video at the end of the game, but essentially it was the game has been declining since January. And then just as the update dropped, it went up a little bit and then right now it's gone back down to before the update. And these were like Samsung numbers. I believe Google Trends graph shows a similar thing where the game was trending really low, it bounced up and then it went back down to where it was before the update. Now, obviously, this is uh slightly concerning as a creator. This is supposed to be the big, you know, the big update, but what I will say is this isn't the Supercell's team big push. There's a big push coming at some point where they're going to advertise the game a lot. They're going to fix a bunch of issues. So, I will say from my perspective, if the game isn't doing well, let's say by the summer, then uh I will be concerned definitely. I I think within the next few months, it should definitely be trending upwards somewhat, but we'll see. Uh from a view perspective, my views are back down to where they were before the update. They're not as far down as they were. They're a little bit above, so not too bad from my perspective. Anyways, let's go over some complaints and some things I want them to change. So, the biggest thing for me, I don't know how you guys feel, is when I go into a Squad League game, why are there always six bots there? I want to play competitive. Obviously, I'm a competitive player. I want to play against 10 real players all battling out for first place. Figure out who's the best, but no, it's always like six bots in a game. And out of those four real players, three of them are Mortise users running around at like 300% quicker speed than me. Uh just doing what they want. Now, I will say as a Royale King user, the Royale King is still the best hero in the game. It's just later game it's better. Early game Mortis is better. Oh yeah, we were talking about bots. So yeah, there's a lot of bots in games. I want to play competitive. Squad League needs a huge revamp. To me, the revamp that they should do is a sort of path of legends system like Clash Royale. Every single season, everyone gets reset down to like tier nine. Let's say tier 9's the bottom tier. And then you have to slowly make your way up to tier one. Lobbies start off kind of easy. Maybe in tier 9 there's like four bots in a lobby. Maybe in tier eight there's three bots. Tier seven there's two bots. Tier six there's one bot. And then tier 5 4 3 2 1 they're all real lobbies. And then you get rewards for climbing up the tiers just like Path of Legends. Cuz right now there's no rewards for grinding in Squad League. We need rewards with our own squad league Path of Legends system. And then let's say once you get to tier one, you're in the top tier. And at this point, maybe you just start getting trophies and you can just grind. But either way, man, stop giving me bot lobbies. The game is too mind-numbingly easy for me. Anyways, obviously I'm more of a competitive player. From a casual perspective, you guys are going to have different problems, but I feel like the Path of Legends system is going to help with giving more rewards. Another thing that I'm really confused about that hasn't been changed is random rotations. Why are random rotations still in the game? I've been playing like gem hunt or duos and then I get like a chicken, a bow, and an El Primo. What the like what? No one wants to use that, dude. That just makes me not want to play the game. Let me choose my rotation. or, you know, if they're going to do random rotations, either a give everybody the same random rotation or b let me have like three rerolls or just a way to reroll my rotation maybe once every 5 minutes. Another thing I want to see, so we went over the squad league revamp. I want a duos revamp. I want there to be a trophy system for duos or I want there to be a reward system for duos. In my opinion, teambased modes is going to be the future of Squidbusters. It just is. This is a good solo game, but in my opinion, it's going to be a bit like Brawl Stars, where teaming is going to be the big thing. So, I think they should go full in more team modes. Don't rush them out. I feel like in December, they rushed out the new modes, showdown and duos. They felt really unpolished. They still are unpolished to this day. In duos, I will sometimes respawn right in my enemy, which is weird. But yeah, no, they should really focus on these modes and improving them. And then obviously to do with Showdown, I'm not even going to go over Showdown. That mode is just horrendous, bro. It's not fun in any way at all. Some other things that I want to see in the future is clans. Clans is the big thing. I don't think we're going to get clans this year. Sadly, I think this year is the year about adding some new heroes, some new troops, fixing stuff, specifically Squad League, the world journey. I think next year is when they'll focus on clans, which I hope they do. I want new worlds. I want new troops. New worlds, man. They were so fun having new worlds, weren't they? But yeah, I'm just going to end it there. That's my little ramble on what I think about the game. I am enjoying the game a lot. There are a lot of problems though, but I've been playing a lot of tournaments recently. They are very, very fun. Team-based modes is what I'm having the most fun doing as well at the moment. And you know what? I'm hopeful for this June update. We're going to have a new hero. I'm sure it's going to be sick. And uh yeah. Anyways, that was my little ramble session. Uh do you like me rambling like this? I don't know. Use code Claus in the Squadbuster shop if you buy anything. and check out my last video on screen right here where I went over the Reddit video. And in this Reddit video, I showed you guys the stats for the game. Very interesting.",
