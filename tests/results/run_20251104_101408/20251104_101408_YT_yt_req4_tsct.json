  "content": "Yo, what's going on guys? Welcome back to a brand new video on the channel. Inside of today's video, yes, the title is not clickbait. We'll be going through it. Squad Busters is getting killed pretty soon. So, we're going to be going over things, giving you guys my thoughts on things because I was an avid Squad Busters uh player. If you guys know, I had a Squad Busters channel upon its global release and got 15,000 subscribers within like a week. I was really really going to push on it. And you can see even by this um like by by overlay, I was really excited about this game's release, but it was very uh quickly apparent to me that it just didn't really have the substance to keep it going as a really popular game. So, just wanted to quickly prove just that I played the game a lot. I dropped it in November, but these are like my stats overall. I haven't played since the Squad Busters 2.0 update, so I'm not completely in tune with absolutely everything with Squad Busters, but I just want to give you guys my thoughts and just what's actually happening right now. So, if you go over to Supercell's Twitter or Squadbusters Twitter, you will see that they tweeted out of themselves. I was surprised, but not surprised if that makes sense because I kind of saw this coming for some months. I was I was the game was in decline for a very long time. But again, Superell just don't go lightly when it comes to killing games. They kill a lot of like betas and stuff, but for a live game, you know, look at Boom Beach and a few other games, you know, hey, well, not heyday, mainly Boom Beach, like they've not killed it even though the revenue isn't really right there or like the daily um the daily the amount of people that download the game daily basically. So, let's go into it. You can click on this article and it gives a lot of information. So, I've not really read through it yet, just myself. Uh but there is um a lot really to talk about. They learned that a lot had gone wrong. The game didn't meet the high expectations that both you and our players is what they're saying. And we at Supercell have for our games. And by early 2025, they faced a true crossroad except that squad bosses might never grow into the global phenomenon they dreamed of or take a big creative uh swing. So they chose to try and swing it to squad busters 2.0 uh which was a bold uh change, but it looked like it didn't really redefine Squad Busters in the right way because my me myself, I didn't even get incentivized to redownload the game. I've seen a lot of creators were uh paid by Supercell to try and like boost the the player base overall. Give Squad Busters another chance. Kind of reminds me of maybe when Brawl Stars switched over from portrait to landscape if I can remember correctly. I always get them mixed up, but yeah, it literally switched its game. It was literally like uh Clash Royale. It was this way up and then they switched it to that way. So that was like a massive controversial change in uh in Brawl Stars' history. So it's been done before and it works. So, Squad Busters probably thought or Supercell thought, well, they can maybe do this again. But, I think it was quite clear that the overall just gameplay lore for me, loop for me, it just wasn't really there. I I I don't know. Like, I I was going to give it a go, but it just didn't really look completely the best. So, uh they also say this is not the outcome they hoped for. They believe it's the right decision. They've been playing it uh but it didn't reach meet the long-term quality bar they hold for themselves. So again, it was it was pretty apparent and I'll go through some of my reasonings as to why I think it didn't thrive. So, um there are a few more games in the development. Moco is a global game and it's still kind of under development because there's not really been any updates for a while. They're probably going to really revamp their system as well. That's probably another topic for another video. Uh but I did enjoy Mo. Um but they're not really It's kind of like they're just playing it down. And I think the reason why Mo playing it down is because of squad busters because they went all in too early. So it's quite clear that they're uh switching up the strategy this time around with Moco. Anyway, we're talking about squad busters. So you can see here what happens next. Inapp purchases are no longer available after roll right now. If you made any more purchases in 2025, you can transfer the value. So unfortunately for me, I probably spent like a thousand, probably even more. And so did Lana, my wife, on Squadbusters in 2024. We dropped it in like November, December time last year because it was just got too repetitive and boring. Uh, but we played it every single day and like for an hour every single day, probably even more. Uh, so that is unfortunate. I don't think we can um claim that pack, but at least for a lot of people, a lot of people probably did spend money during the Squad Busters 2.0, so you guys can transfer it over to another game, which is still pretty nice from the uh Supercell team. going to do this with betas. Uh but I didn't realize I'd do this with a live game as well. So there's also some rewards. It looks like some exclusive uh theme. Yeah. Okay. These rewards will be available starting November. Um this brings news questions on November was shared written Q&A in game. Okay. So that I'd actually want to read that because I really want to see uh their actual reasons as to why they killed Squad Busters. So I'm excited for that. Um, but yeah, hopefully some of the future games can live on and meet the expectations. So, you know what? It actually made me sad like as a Supercell fan, a Supercell game enjoyer since I can remember what like since Clash of Clans came out, it does make me sad cuz you just know like these are really real people that put all their time, energy, and resources into making such a good game. Trust me, Supercell is like no other games company. I'm not being paid to say that. And like I've seen their passion firsthand when I went over. I've been over multiple times now and these are like amazing people. So you can hate the game, but don't hate the people behind it. I always say that with every game that I play and I hope you guys share that same opinion. So I just wanted to see this. This is 6 months ago on Reddit Squad Busters. Just look at the revenue dive down. So this was made 6 months ago. So it's just obviously gone down and down. It's reached like 200k in revenue. Uh which again I was just like, \"Okay, they've clearly got to do something and kill the game.\" I don't know. So of course on global launch 22 million but they spent a lot on marketing 11 million 8 million. So the it really dived down pretty quickly and quickly after December like down to 1 million down to 1.4 it just kept going down even with a squad boosters 2.0. So quickly I wanted to show you guys the Google trends on this. Of course it's a little bit unfair. You can't even see. I mean that was when it was released globally and then you know it did have some peaks. Again, my squabbles channel did pop off for a little while, but then it was clear that the gameplay loop was just pretty bad. But if you remove um Brawl Stars because it's probably like too high in terms of hype and then Clash Royale as well. Let's compare it to even Boom Beach. I mean, it's literally on the level of Boom Beach for an entire year pretty much after November. Yeah, like the hype it kind of came up a little bit here and then Squad Busters 2.0 here in May. I mean, like it's just straight downhill. It is pretty sad to see. So, I'm going to remind you guys as well what Squad Busters actually added to the game. They added Sonic into the game. I thought Sonic was going to be in Brawl Stars and a lot of people really like this update, but again, another thing that I was really confused on with Squad Busters in terms of their like strategy is that they were like, you know, Transformers or like the game just came out and they were doing a transform transformers collaboration, which is cool. Collaborations are cool, but we've seen it in Brawl Stars, right? A lot of people, you know, collaborations are good for the short-term player base, but they like the long-term players, they want some substance. They want some good updates. They want some mechanical change, some gameplay changes, etc. They want long-term things. Collaborations will just get people back, but it won't keep people playing for long if the overall gameplay isn't exciting. So, that's why I was a bit like, hm, why are they doing so many collaborations when the game is clearly not that fun to play? I I I don't know. But Sonic was a really cool collaboration and they still killed the game even though Sonic was a collab. So yeah, quite scary. Quite scary. You can see here that they even they knew that they were making jokes around Squad Busters dying squad save literally themselves. They they kind of it kind it gave me the impression that this was like do or die for them. They even said it in the blog post up here that uh they took this bold risk. It was basically do or die. That update was do or die and it didn't relive the game. So, also this ad, by the way, was one of the best ads I've seen in Superstellar history. It was you could tell the marketing was just their budget was probably insane. It probably was like 50 million or something. I'm not even exaggerating. A really good ad. I again, I was a bit skeptic because um for me, they they just released it too early. They released the game too early. So, I've got like a few points here to kind of round off the video in terms of my overall thoughts. So, I'll go back to the blog here. Let's let's talk about what why I think Squad Busters uh died and why they couldn't fix their problem. So, I'll put some Brawl Stars gameplay in the background just briefly while I talk about this because nobody really wants to watch Squad Busters gameplay. It's a Brawl Stars channel. Uh but you know, the overall gameplay loop is boring or was boring. Again, I experienced this after playing for like 6 months straight probably since global launch and even in beta days. Like I really enjoyed the game for what it was, but there it just never really like itched something on the back of my brain in terms of competitiveness. I just a lot of players were complaining about it, but I was just trying to give it a chance because, you know, the UI looked really cool. The idea around Squad Busters looked really cool. You could see that Supercell was really pushing for this to be a great game. So when I saw like the marketing was going heavy on Squad Busters, I knew I had to try and jump on this train because Supercell, we don't normally just throw out a game when it's not ready. normally is a masterpiece. You know, Supercell games have been some of the best games in mobile, well definitely in mobile space, maybe even in of all time. Brawl Stars, Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, Hay, these are some staple names. And you know, Squad Busters were bringing all the lore of all the Super games together. I thought it could have potential, but again, there was like no skill in fights, which is a big one. You think of I mean, mobile games aren't really that skillful, guys. Just put it out there. No, there are elements of skill definitely in Clash of Clans Clash Royale Boost Stars. There is some. You'd be dumb to say there isn't. But Squad Busters, I was like, hm, I played this game for 6 months and every game I was like, where is the skill? Where, you know, I'm not even improving. I'm not noticing any skill. The fights just feel random. Most of the time I don't know what I'm doing. And you know, I'm not, you know, I'm not saying just because I was a prime pro, I'm not saying I'm like I'm the best gamer in the world and I know everything about games, but I I've been a gamer my whole life. I've, you know, I've no lifed so many different games. So for me, I thought normally I'm accomplished at a game when I'm grinding it that much. And for Squad Busters, I was like, I I don't feel like even though I've put so much time into the game, I don't feel like I'm, you know, I'm outsmarting opponents. I don't feel like I'm I don't feel all these hours doesn't make me a better player. Does that make sense? I I was It was so frustrating. That's why of of course I quit literally a year ago. Again, people just ran away pretty much all the time in squad busters. It wasn't there was no incentive to really run into people. You didn't want any of your squad members to die or else it would take a long time to replenish your squad. You know, if you killed if you had like a big fight in a one versus one and you you beat the squad, but then your whole squad is depleted. There was hardly any ways to ramp back up and get back into the fight. So, it actually again was another negative to fight. There was just so many negatives to fighting and a lot of time it was just like a farming simulator, which you know, sometimes it could be pretty cool. It seemed as like a chill game. it it felt like a bit more of a heyday like I was just running around the map bombing resources with Mavis and Greg rather than actually like fighting people most of the time. So again, no skill expression and yeah, a lot of people were just not sure what was really going on in the game. There's probably a lot of other issues as well where the real hardcore squad was players probably would let me know down in comment sections below why they think the game died. But I think as a like I wouldn't even say myself as a casual, but I think the casuals just knew the overall gameplay loop just wasn't it. So for me, for for squads just to I think they were just doomed from the start. I think to really uh bring a conclusion to this. They were doomed from the start. I feel like the game just wasn't ready. I think a lot of people and creators were surprised after speaking to them when it was released that they were actually going for a global release this soon because there were so many problems. And it weren't even like there were just a few issues. it it was quite clear that the game just wasn't ready. It it it just wasn't there was so many gameplay loop issues to begin with. But maybe they thought, okay, let's just there probably some internal pressure, right? Because there hadn't been a game released since Brawl Stars. What was that, like seven years ago? Probably even seven, six years ago. Um but yeah, probably internal pressure trying to get a actual live game. And then maybe they thought, \"Okay, so we won't know how to fix the problems unless we throw this game out to the live public and then we can fix the problems as they go along.\" But, you know, bugs and stuff and small changes to like the economy and whatever. Yeah, if they can be fixed, but the overall gameplay loop that takes a lot of time, a lot of development, of course, it does. We've seen that's why Squad Busters took a long time to even make Squad Busters 2.0. That's why Mo were taking like 3 months to the next update. It's It's quite clear the game just wasn't ready. I just don't think they should have rushed it in the end. I don't know whether Squad Busters was just doomed from the start, whether it just overall just wasn't a good game. Can we just say it's not a good game. I mean, I don't know what I don't want to seem harsh and just saying that, but overall it just wasn't. So, yeah, a lot of frustration. I'm hoping that future Supercell games do reach the high level of quality that I've reached in the past. I have um definitely. Yeah, I have high hopes. They'll definitely do because Mocha was I did drop Mocha a lot sooner than Squad Busters, but I think it's quite clear they were taking a different strategy with it and you know there's this new game boat game that I've seen some creators play. There's like a few others in the works. So I'm hoping they can finally release a good global game. But for now, you know, I'm happy with Brawl Stars. Clash Royale is seeing record levels for like since its launch 10 plus years ago. Brawl Stars is on the climb up again. I'm happy with these games for now. So yeah, that's going to be it, guys. Hope you enjoyed this one. A sad day for many people, but I think it's a day that we've seen coming for a long time. I'm going to continue with the Brawl Stars content, though, guys. Don't you worry about it. That's going to be it. Hope you guys enjoyed. Don't forget to like, comment, unsubscribe.",
