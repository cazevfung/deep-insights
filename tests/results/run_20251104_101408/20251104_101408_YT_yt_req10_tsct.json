  "content": "There are now seven total Supercell games that are global, and all of these games have faced many ups and downs over the years. However, when looking at them in this current moment, the futures of some of the games look really promising, while others not so much. And today, we'll be going over what the future of each of these games could look like. So, let's get straight into it with Supercell's oldest game, which is Heyday. Now, this game is over 13 years old, and I'm sure you probably haven't heard of it for a long time, but that's because it is pretty separated from the audience of all the other Supercell games. Heyday has really just been thriving quietly in the background with it getting close to the same number of downloads as Clash of Clans and Brawl Stars last month, and just the last year alone, they have done a lot, such as collaborating with Gordon Ramsay. And the future just honestly looks pretty good. I mean, their latest video on the channel is sitting at over three million views, which shows there is still a pretty active player base and community, and it does actually seem like Heyday has been getting more active in the last few months. Heyday is just an interesting game because it is the only single player PVE game that Supercell has, which is why you don't hear about it as much because it just attracts a different player base. And clearly, this player base is very strong. And I would honestly say Heyday has the best community out of all the Supercell games, which is why the future just looks really bright. And I really think Heyday will continue to thrive for many more years. Supercell really doesn't need to do a lot to keep this game thriving. And that's why it has one of the best futures when compared to the other Supercell games. And the game with arguably the worst future is Squad Busters, which has been one of Supercell's biggest failures. Squadbusters was globally launched last year and its release was very controversial because it felt extremely rushed and it seemed like Supercell released it just for the sake of getting a new global game out there as they hadn't released anything since Brawl Stars 5 years ago. This game had been heavily promoted through the other major Supercell games and there was a big marketing push to make as many people aware as possible and this caused the game to be extremely popular when it had global launch and there were big numbers. However, these would slide extremely quickly. And over a year later, the game is the worst performing out of all the Supercell games. It still has a tight and active community, and Supercell is still actively working on the game, and they are very active with it. However, we just haven't seen much growth, and it just hasn't been performing well. The main reason for this is simply because the game didn't have enough content to support so many people and it wasn't tested enough and that made it underwhelming for the global release and most people just stopped playing and forgot about the game. Currently, it just isn't looking good for squadbusters and I really have doubts about the future of this game. Even though Supercell is actively working on it, I just don't see too much actually happening towards bringing players back to the game. And I really think Supercell needs to make another big push to market the game to remind people it still exists and to show them how it is a lot better now because the game definitely has improved, but no one knows about it since they stopped playing it a while ago and probably forgot it even existed because Supercell really isn't doing anything about it at all. This game definitely has potential, but right now the future is looking very bleak if Supercell doesn't change anything. And that is why I really think it has the worst future out of all the Supercell games. The last time I made a video like this was around when Squad Busters was set to globally launch. And at the time, I had said that Boom Beach had the worst future, but that has changed now, partly because we saw how Squad Busters performed, but also because Boom Beach has actually gotten better. At the time, Boom Beach had been really struggling with a small player base and community, and it seemed like a very dead game because it was barely getting any noticeable updates, and progress had slowed down a lot with new headquarter levels barely coming out. And this basically made it so there wasn't much to do, which drove many players away from the game. Plus, it was very similar to Clash of Clans. So many people just picked that over Boom Beach. And the Boom Beach team also wasn't really active on social media. And it had been over a year since they last posted on their YouTube channel. So it really seemed like the game had been abandoned. But all of that would change about 3 months ago when the first Beach Talk episode was released. And even though this episode didn't have any big news, it was the first sign of life back into the game. and it actually gave people hope that Supercell was starting to focus on Boom Beach again and they were going to actually give it more attention and hopefully revive it. A month ago, we got the second Beach Talk episode and this contained a major update, which was the first major update in a very long time. And this introduced new things, including a new currency. And this was really a massive deal because the game was finally starting to move again with new things. and it was clear they were trying to get people back to playing the game by introducing something unique. This was also available at HQ level 11, meaning a lot of older players could have it unlocked and newer players could reach that level relatively quickly and it wasn't something that was meant for only highlevel players and that was a good thing and it showed how the team was really trying to target a wide group of players. There hasn't been much that has happened since then. However, this is a really good sign for the future of the game, and we could possibly be seeing a Boom Beach comeback in 2025 and 2026. And this is definitely not something I was expecting. So, it'll be really interesting to see how that plays out. Another thing I wasn't expecting was a Clash Royale comeback, and this is probably the most surprising thing to happen this year when it comes to Supercell. This game has seen a massive resurgence in popularity in the last few months because before that it seemed like things were getting really bad with all the bad updates that had been happening and with the whole player base seeming to turn their backs on the game because of just everything that was happening when it came to the pay to- win aspect. However, the game is now the most profitable Supercell game and also the fastest growing one. And a big reason for this is honestly because of content creators just making the game more popular and more well-known to a completely new audience. We have seen a bunch of big streamers playing the game and advertising it to their big audiences. And this has driven downloads and revenue and the game is just extremely popular now. And this is very surprising because a few months ago it seemed like it was at a very low point. It seems like the game getting a new audience really helped because these new players obviously haven't experienced the last few years and they haven't seen what the game is like at the higher levels and that is why all the negativity around the game has basically been drowned out. I don't think this is a bad thing and honestly I am more so just surprised because it didn't seem like there was a lot Supercell could do to restore the image and reputation of the game and Supercell actually didn't need to do anything since other people popularized the game again and Supercell really didn't have to do anything in order for this to happen. I really do think Clash Royale is a good game with the whole concept of it and everything. And the only thing that had kind of ruined it was the pay to- win stuff that had been getting worse and worse over the years. So, it definitely is nice to see the game getting more love. And I really hope Supercell takes this resurgence and uses it to make the game better to retain more players. But, we'll really have to see how it plays out and how long it can last. But, I really do think we see the game in an uptrend for at least the rest of the year. And after that, we'll really just have to see whether or not the trend dies down and how the players move with the trend. But now, let's move on to Clash of Clans, which was the first Clash game to exist. In 2024, Clash of Clans had seen a big comeback with a lot of new events, and the game had really just become more active and more faster paced. And this had brought a lot of players to the game, and it was growing pretty fast. Nowadays, it has definitely slowed down a little bit, but the game is still growing and it is still getting big collaborations. And the future of the game honestly looks pretty bright because it has already been super successful for so long. And I really see the game thriving for at least the next 5 to 10 years. The only questionable part about the future of Clash of Clans is with the builder base and clan capital since those are two big parts of the game that have basically been abandoned. And I think it will be really important to see how Supercell treats them. But the main part of the game is obviously the home village and Supercell is clearly focused on that. So the future of the game isn't fully dependent on the other two bases and it clearly has been doing well with them not playing a big role, but I think it is still something to consider. But overall, the game is doing just fine. And Brawl Stars is in a very similar situation as well. This game had also seen a big comeback in 2024 and late 2023, and it had actually gotten even bigger than its previous peak, which is something you rarely see happen in the gaming world. Brawl Stars definitely has cooled down a bit in 2025, and it isn't as big as it was, but it is still relatively healthy in my opinion. It did have some controversies with the biggest one being with the Toy Story collaboration where there was a limited time Buzz Lightyear brawler that had basically ruined the game during the time it was available. But other than that, the game has been doing pretty well and it has just cooled down from the massive runup it had last year, and that is perfectly normal. Brawl Stars is still a massive and iconic game, and I really don't see it going anywhere in the near or even long-term future. And this is easily a game that can thrive for the next few decades, which is good to see. But but finally, we have the newest Supercell game, which is called Mode.co. And this is something really strange. The roll out of this game is something we haven't seen before because it is globally available. But up until a few weeks ago, you actually needed an invite in order to play the game. And this is basically the opposite of what happened with Squadbusters since the global release of this game has honestly been low-key. And Supercell hasn't really promoted it much, which is also why it doesn't really have any big numbers. And performance-wise, it is near the bottom with Squad Busters and Boom Beach, but hopefully that will change soon as Supercell markets the game more since they recently made it so you didn't need an invite anymore to play. However, the future of the game does face some problems because of the whole progress reset aspect as everyone gets reset at the end of every season. And this is different from all of the other Supercell games where you build up over time and progress. Whether that means upgrading your town hall in Clash of Clans or just unlocking and upgrading brawlers inside of Brawl Stars, this new game doesn't seem to have that stuff and that makes it harder to retain players because they don't have anything to look forward to. And that is probably the biggest thing holding the game back from success in my opinion. Outside of that, the game is cool and interesting, but it definitely needs something to retain players. If they can figure that out, then the future looks super bright. But as of right now, it's a little shaky in my opinion, and we'll really just have to see how it plays out. But that's also it for this video. I really hope you all enjoyed, and I'll catch you all in the next one.",
