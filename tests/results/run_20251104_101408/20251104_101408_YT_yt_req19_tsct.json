  "content": "application crashes, a very long wait time, and players boycotting what happened in the Clash of Clans October update. What's going on, my friends from Clash of Clans? My name is Joe, and man, this is one of those videos where it's like, should I skip over this idea or should I address it? You know what? Let's just have a conversation for once. You know, like I don't want to teach you anything. There's really nothing to teach here. You know what I mean? Like I believe that you guys are really passionate, right? We can agree on that. like we love or hate Clash of Clans. I mean, if you're watching Clash of Clans content and you tune in frequently, you care about the game a lot. And the update dropped and for those of you that might live under a rock or something, basically what happened is Clash of Clans did a complete overhaul of the trophy system. You know, separating attacking for loot for um trophies. And the new trophy system is very interesting. It's a little confusing for players that haven't really been in the know or they've never played in Legends League. Um, but this update also came with a lot of issues, like a lot of things that were unforeseen. Now, let me tell you my perspective. I've been playing this game for a lot longer than most people that are watching. Probably longer than I should have, like 12 years at this point, maybe a little longer. And I've been covering this game on YouTube for six years. I cannot imagine what it's like to be the developer of this game. I really can. I mean, to have such a passionate audience that cares about the development of the game or the improvement of the game and then to deliver a product and then have issues. I mean, come on. Can you imagine the stress these people are going through? I'm not going to bash anybody. I'm not going to take anybody's side on this because it's just one of those situations of they tried, you know, and some things went right, some things went wrong. the skins were causing application crashing like from the beginning. And then there was the situation where we logged into the account and signed up for rank battles and the tournament didn't start for 18 hours which was super annoying because you know when you watch sneak peeks you get all hyped up about this the update and you're like heck yeah bro I want to play that and then you got to wait 18 hours. I logged out. I'm not going to lie to you. I logged in, set my base, start the tournament, and then realized there was an 18 hour wait time, and I was like, I'm not going to sit around and wait on this, you know. Okay, cool. A couple of revenges. That's where I messed up. I should have hung in there and waited for the revenges, which we'll talk about here in a moment. But, uh, yeah, I logged out and went and took care of a personal issue and came back later in the day to a metric ton of drama. I mean, we're going to take a look at Reddit here in a moment, but let me tell you a few things that I do not like about this update. And one of those things has to do with these badges. I'm going to be real with you. I'm not a big fan of change first and foremost. I mean, once I know something and I enjoy playing something a certain way, I'm not really open to a lot of changes unless it's like an improvement that I can't deny. But the redesign of the Trophy League badges was I don't understand. I just don't get it. And and what I mean by that is the original badges, they were introduced early early game. And I'm talking the bronze, the silver, the gold, the crystal, and then master moving into champion. Champion was the highest league for a long time. And then I believe the release of Town Hall 11 is when they released Titan and Legend League. And that was 10 years ago. So those badges have been around for I mean, think about it. somebody that was playing at 15 years old is now 26, 27. You know what I mean? Like those badges have been around for a really long time. And I feel personally that they should have just updated the graphics there and kept those badges. That's just my opinion. I'm not a big fan of these badges. I mean, I'm not going to sit here and lie to you. I know some people might like them and they are pretty cool, but I just don't personally like them at all. Then the other change is something that's stupid. It's really, really petty, but when you click attack, I have this habit of clicking the right side of the screen to launch the battle. And I keep doing it and doing this. I'll go in and do this. And I'm like, you know what I mean? Like something so basic, just a user interface situation. I don't like the redesign of this menu personally, but it is what it is, right? I mean, I can complain about things and and it, you know, like you just got to roll with it. But, um, yeah, those are two things that I didn't like about this. I do like the fact that I can attack freely for resources using battles. And I'm speaking from somebody that was playing on a rush base up in fake legends to try to get the ore. And then I would get up into Legends League and get trapped because I could not I I either had to sign up for the eight attacks a day or I could not attack for resources. So, that is good. The other thing that a lot of players are complaining about right now is the fact that they did push all the way up to Legends League or whatever, which was not that difficult to do. Let's be real, guys. I mean, if you pushed up to Legends League before this update, you probably did it very easily and you thought that you were going to be placed in a relatively high league. And I understand. Here's the reason why people are upset. Let's jump back into that menu right there. League overview. being up in this league right here, like maybe Titan 26, you're getting over a thousand shiny ore and then 58 of the glowy ore and one star ore. People wanted to be up here because they wanted the most resources for their attacks, right? Um, but what ultimately happened is they got shifted back down to here because of their town hall level or whatever the case may be on migration. Um, and they're they're not not happy about it. Of course, they're not happy about it because they did all the work prior to the update and now they're shifted back down. But that's it is what it is, right? It gives you a starting point to move up. That's the way I'm trying to see it. Got put in golem 19 and now my opportunity or what I need to do is attack and climb up. And it's really based on offenses and defenses. And I think that's something that players aren't really accustomed to because in the old system it didn't matter. You could have the best base right here and you're going to get attacked. You knew that you were going to get attacked by higher level players and get crushed and you might defend against lower level or equal town halls to yourself. But if you stayed online, you could just push up through the trophy ranges. That's not the case anymore because now you are limited on the amount of attacks that you can have to climb up through the trophy system. And that's something that people do not like. Is it fair? I feel like it's fairer than what it was before, to be honest. I mean, let's be real. As a Town Hall 15, I really have no business up in Legends League, you know, because my defenses are just too easy for a Town Hall 17. They're going to come in and wipe the floor with me, but then at the same time, I really do need the ore to uh upgrade my hero abilities, you know. So, let's jump into Reddit because that's that's going to lead us into this conversation right here. And and this is something that um it's the first thing that pops up as soon as I got on Reddit like this morning, yesterday afternoon and there's a lot of frustration and I understand the frustration because we weren't online for it, right? Don't lie. Don't even try to lie. You know, if you were online, you would have exploited this situation. First and foremost, as an official Clash of Clans content creator, I have uh legal documents with the developer, so I really can't endorse bugs, okay? Okay, I'm not supposed to do it. As much as I would love to, I am not allowed to do it. So, even if I would have found this bug, I wouldn't have been able to tell you guys about it anyways because it goes against what, you know, my agreement with the developers. So, okay. So, here's the post right here that says, \"We want equal ores for everyone.\" This is the quote unquote boycott that's happening right now on Reddit by very, very passionate players like yourself. And it's completely understandable. But there's one here that goes into a little bit more details on their feelings about the update. The situation was the org glitch. Worst thing that came as part of this update. Possibly the most game-breaking hours of this game's history. Unintentional, but nonetheless gamebreaking and economy crashing. Completely unfair to players who spent years grinding or just not to even be maxed. And for some, others random to be lucky for one afternoon and max their entire account. And they aren't even rolling it back. Um, the developer's aware of this and I'm not really sure what they're going to do about it. Whether they're going to speak out publicly about it, I really don't know. I I I can't speak for the developer, but I can just give my, you know, insight on what I feel about this as well. The update itself, the update goes against the core philosophy of the game. It's an update cratered to please rushers. They have nerfed the leagues in this game by a huge amount. Anyone who is lower town hall who play consistently before the update could hit high leagues for maximum ores attack bonus and it actually felt rewarding. Now, no matter how much you play, you're always locked into the lower league with lower loot. I was a town hall 13 in legends before the update getting 100 uh getting 1,000 shiny ore. Now I'm in Valkyrie getting 600. It's all about rushing this game to Town Hall 17, baby. Not maxing your base like the game was originally designed for. Okay, I will admit that I do know that uh based on a couple of the changes done in the last year, Clash of Clans, example, in this update, they removed the town hall weapons. Clash of Clans does want us to move on through the town hall levels a little bit faster. I don't think they want you to rush, but like we saw in my current free-to-play series, the newest one, uh there are moments where you do need to rush a little bit because of the excessive amount of resources that are available on your bases, and you got to move on, right, to spend it. Also, the icons are soulless and bland in the new update. We'll skip over that cuz I already kind of talked about that from my own personal feelings. Other launch problems, the game kept crashing, skins were lost, trophies weren't showing, the leagues didn't start for lower leagues. So, I it didn't feel like the update actually came. Just a bunch of launch issues. The community most divided it's ever been. Anyone who got lucky enough to get the ores is flexing, telling people to stop crying about the ore glitch. And everyone else is telling Supercell to roll the update back and fix the economy. Okay. So, I'm going to start by saying I was not a part of the glitch. I I'm I wasn't there. I was kind of busy doing real life things. cuz I had like a situation with the bank that I needed to deal with. So, I didn't get to participate in doing some revenges and getting a bunch of free ore. That would have been really cool, but uh that was definitely not the case. Now, let me let me give you some insight here. There's been updates in the past where things have gone wrong. You know what I mean? It it's happened many times before. Not to this extent, I don't think, but it's happened and we've gotten past it. Will the developer go back on things and find out those players or seek out those players that got lucky and exploited the bug? Nobody knows. We We don't know. We don't know. We don't know what the developers doing, you know. Um but at the same time, it's like what does it matter, you know? We can't control it. Why are we getting so upset about something like this, you know? And I've seen people on here actually threatening that they weren't going to spend any more money on the game. That's your choice. You know what I mean? like do what you got to do, but at the same time, let's not ruin the experience for everyone, you know? Like sometimes there's there's already enough negativity in the world as it is, right? So why are we bringing a ton of negativity into the very thing that is supposed to help us escape the negative things happening in real life? That's just my opinion. You know what I mean? So at the end of the day, will the developer do something about this? I don't think they will. But will players stop playing for a little while? I'm sure. You know, but then they'll come back because their friends are still playing and you know, like it's just one of those things you just got to navigate through and try to lessen your expectations. I guess I I was telling one of my friends about this a few years ago. Uh he used to come to me like just before every single update and had like all these expectations and I'm like, \"Bro, you need to scale it back. Like the developer is not going to go that crazy.\" you know, they're not going to give you so much that, you know, it's just not going to happen. You got to kind of scale it back. And that's something that I've learned over time with any game for that matter is that you can set your expectations way up here, but the reality is you're going to have some form of disappointment because you kind of cooked up this vision in your head of what things should be and then come to find out that was not the case. So, I don't know. The game update had a lot of issues, but at the end of the day, we just got to come together and find the enjoyment that we once found before all this drama. Let's just chalk it up for drama of 2025. The ore glitch that broke the game for so many players. I don't think it broke the game. At the end of the day, I still have no ore and I still need to upgrade a bunch of pieces of equipment to navigate through this account. Does it give me something to do? Yep.",
