  "content": "How did Brawl Stars go from being one of the most thriving games in 2024, reaching their all-time peak that year to losing almost everything they had built up the very next year? This is probably the most critical state Brawl Stars has ever been in. Like, it's pretty terrible. And sadly, some people think it's kind of their fault for their own downfall because everyone is looking at them like, \"What went wrong? How did you guys fumble the bag so quick? Like, you just got the bag.\" But I'll tell you how they fumbled the bag. They don't listen to their fans. Like the entire community be voicing their opinions on changes Brawlstar should make that can make the game so much better. But this is what we look like trying to suggest any good ideas to them. Yes, they're like that brick wall. I feel like Brawl Star's downfall really started happening during the season events. Now, don't get me wrong, for the most part, the events are normally really cool. I actually like them. But the issue with these events was progressing without spending any money. But of course, if you know life the game, yes, you will still see some pretty good progression if you don't want to spend any money. But here's the thing, it was a massive grind. So, most free-to-play players weren't really happy on how challenging it was to make progress by not spending money, which is understandable. I mean, if you look at the Katana Kingdom event, so many people were complaining about the sushi rolls, and I feel their pain because they just wasn't splitting. And if you play it during that event, I'm pretty sure that you know that this was far from a lie. Now, I do understand why Brawl Stars made it a bit difficult because obviously if they gave out too many sushi, everyone would unlock the skins too fast. And from a business standpoint, they probably looked at it like if they can keep us grinding for the sushi throughout the entire season, then they could see an increase on their player retention, which is not a bad business move, but come on, at least make it a little bit more balanced. Now, and even during a Pizza Planet event, I can honestly say that this one started off pretty bad because of one major issue. People were getting way too many pizza slices on the first day. Now, not because they got it from grinding the game. It was because the game was a little too buggy. Like, people were getting a crazy amount of pizza slices. And this all happened because players who had leftover Crusty Cash, for some reason, it converted into pizza slices. What? Which I don't know how, but it happened. Now, when this glitch happened to certain people, bro, they were cashing out because most people looked at it like, \"Hey, I have all these pizza slices. Let me go ahead and do a little bit of spending. They legit bought everything in the store.\" Now, I'm not going to lie, all those people that was spending those pizza slices could have crashed the game economy. And for those who don't know what crashing a game economy mean, I'll put a screenshot up and you can just pause the video and read it. Now, Brawl Stars did catch wind of this pretty quick, so thankfully they fixed it. But just this issue alone wasn't the only bug this season. We had to deal with getting stuck on the loading screen, incorrect ticket counts, and difficulties joining the contest. It was just bad. And on top of that, during this season, we had Buzz Lightyear as a temporary brawler, which was a really cool concept, but ultimately it was just annoying seeing lobbies full of Buzz Lightyears, if I'm being honest. And a lot of people felt the same way. Like players were legit upset that they made him so broken. Like, I get it's hard to balance a temporary brawler because if you make them too weak, then players aren't going to be interested to even use them, which would be a waste of money because I'm pretty sure that they poured a lot of money into Buzz Lightyear. So, I don't think balancing this brawler was a high priority. So, what did they do instead? They made him broken and they gave him a hypercharge. Oh, and three different modes. Sounds like a perfect brawler, right? Let's go now. Now, besides the events that's been buggy or having bad progression, in my honest opinion, I just feel like Brawl Stars have to get out of their comfort zone, like just in general, because this game can thrive so much more if they can just stop boxing theirelves in creatively. Because I don't know if they're just afraid of trying new things or maybe if they're afraid of trusting the community opinions. Now, I'm not going to say that they don't trust us at all, but like if they can put a little more trust in us is basically what I'm trying to say. Like if they can just give us the creative tools, we can all thrive together as a community and be even bigger and better. Pause. That sounded crazy. Look, I'm not going to lie, there is no reason why Mapm Maker is still not good. Like, yes, they made minor changes, but it wasn't anything super impactful. Like, it still feel like we're so limited to expressing ourselves creatively. Like, look at Fortnite or Roblox for an example. There is a whole dedicated fan base to just mapmaking and creating unique experiences. Like Fortnite had to legit make genres for what you wanted to play because people were just getting that creative. And same goes for Roblox. They got a whole library of stuff, bro. They even made Brawl Stars in Roblox, huh? And I heard it's fire. Supercell, you better stop playing before they take your fans bars. Now, another thing I feel like us as a community kind of dislike is recycle game modes. Like for example, we had a mini Uno event during the Dark Sands update. Now, during this event, they introduced us to a Chester Uno skin challenge and a Uno game mode. And to be honest, it was pretty cool. But then they brought the same exact game mode back. And if I'm being real, stuff like this really do make people mad because they want something new. Like at this point, people are starting to say that Brawl Stars is getting a little repetitive now. And it hurts hearing that because if I'm being real, this is legit my favorite game. Now, I don't want to sit here and discredit them like they don't try to make changes to the game. Like, for example, they made multiple changes to rank because they want players to have a better experience because we know the old rank was kind of bad. But unfortunately, here's a problem. It's their own players that's making rank a terrible experience for other players. Because I think we all know at this point that there's a really bad cheating problem going on. Like some of the top players in the world are using cheats. If you go to the global leaderboard, you can see that they're trying to sell cheats to other players that are desperate to climb the rank ladder, which I don't understand why they're buying cheats or even using cheats because technically you didn't really earn that spot, but I guess man, you stupid But luckily, all those people that have been buying or selling cheats is finally getting caught by Supercell because like a couple of weeks ago, they've banned a lot of accounts, which thankfully Supercell finally caught on to it because I'm not going to lie, rank was terrible. I mean, it's still terrible right now, but let's just hope that it gets a little better. But I don't even think people cheating is the only thing that's ruining the player experience. It's honestly having bad randoms, too. Like I've been playing Brawl Stars for quite a while now and it feels like bad randoms are getting worse as time goes by. Like I'm being so serious. Sometimes I really question if I'm playing with an actual bot or someone that just don't care about the game at all. Now for those who actually try their hardest but just not that good at the game yet. I'm not talking about you guys. At least you're trying. I'm talking about the ones that literally just run in a straight line spamming auto aim and just hoping they get a kill. out of pocket for that Way out of pocket. What do you gain from that? Bad randoms give me headaches. Now, I really do feel like if Brawl Stars can just make certain changes to the game, I can almost guarantee that they'll thrive again. Like, the team over at Brawl Stars should just really take their time and come up with a game plan on how they're going to make a comeback. Because if I'm being honest, I feel like they've been in a dry spell lately. Like, am I the only one that feel like new brawlers been so boring lately? I'm sorry, but Kaz was kind of boring. And even some of our recent brawlers before Kaz just didn't hit. And I'm pretty sure you guys feel the same way, too. Like, they've been releasing brawlers a little too fast, which I don't think is the smartest idea because it sort of takes away the excitement when new brawlers are coming out because we're getting them like almost every single month. It got to the point where we kind of expect a new brawler every new season. But before I end off this video, what are your thoughts on this topic? Do you think Brawl Stars will make a comeback? Let me know in the comments.",
