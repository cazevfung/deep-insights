  "content": "We're back again on the Squadbusters Reddit. But before we check that out, let's check out this post here saying, \"Squadbusters breaks revenue record this month. For the first time ever, Squadbusters has made more money than the previous month hitting 1 million. Was it because of the May update?\" Yes. So, Squadbusters since June last year has every month made less money than the month well previously. And they finally made more money than the month previously. As you guys can see here in a post that I made not too long ago, this only shows you since February, which is the hatchling run update, but they made 1.4 mil, then it went down to 1.2 mil, then it went down to 0.8 mil, and then for the first time ever, it's actually gone up to 1 million in May for the update. So, does this mean that the game is finally getting big now? Well, there's only two ways to tell how big a game is, at least for me. Revenue is a good indicator, of course, but not the best indicator. You also have Google Trends as well, as you see right here. This is the last 90 days. We can see the game was about uh 30ish before the update. 25 31 24 25 30 then obviously we got update news here the update here and then now it's back down to about 23 25 29 and this is because we got a little uh event. So yeah, the game is I would say slightly bigger than April but smaller than before April which actually lines up with the revenue. But I also got this really interesting post recently. First of all, I made a post saying, \"How do we feel about the popularity of squad busters after the update?\" And then you see 26% think it's more popular. 45% of people think it's the same. I believe the same as well. And then 28% think it's less popular. Now, if we scroll down, this guy said the game is still going down. And then he sent this screenshot here that shows apparently all Samsung device users. And we can see 16 weeks ago, which is 4 months ago around February, the game had 310,000 players. Then 12 weeks ago, it had 272,000 players. 8 weeks ago, 217,000 players. So, it's going down. Only a month ago, which was around the update, or I guess when they started hyping the update, it actually went up to 257,000 people playing. But this week, it is down to 193,000 people playing. Now, this is only for Samsung device users. Obviously, I'm an iPhone. I'm not included in this stat, etc., etc., etc. But damn, that that actually shocked me. I thought it would be up, especially like 8 weeks ago, the game was not in a good state. Let's admit, but somehow it's lower than that, but I would say this is because a lot of people have quit the game because they're not happy, and we haven't gotten the big boost of new players yet. I assume when we get the big boost of new players, that's when it will start to go up. And for people interested, this is Clash Royale. Look at it. 4 months ago, 2.6 million. This week, nearly 4 million people on Samsung devices. That game is just going crazy. Anyways, let's get into the Reddit. Who is better, Leon or Max? My opinion, it's going to be Leon. Max gives you good speed. Leon gives you speed and damage. I run max at the start. You see, I wouldn't do that. I would do Leon. Leon, he boosts your speed and attack damage when you use an ability, which you will surely use when seeing an enemy or even when being chased. Yeah, I agree. Boosting the attack speed is solely why Leon is better. Both make you faster, but only one boost the damage, too. And this guy is speaking facts. Can they nerf this abhorren? Okay, Bro does not like Mortis. I'll be honest, Royale King is the better hero in the game. Mortise is not the best hero. Although, what I will say is I've been playing a lot of scrims recently. You guys know this. And in scrims, you can actually ban spells. And whenever people ban chicken clones and coin stash, it makes mortise broken because the royal king can't really counter the mortise user if you're taking away the royal king speed and coins. Um, but yeah, no, Mortis is good. I don't think he needs a nerf. I think they need to wait before nerfing any heroes too much. I would say wait like a month or two for everyone to have more maxed out heroes so we can then see exactly where the meta is at. Yeah, he's too broken. Maybe the developers will nerf him after June's update. All the Okay, so yeah, this guy's not happy with the Mortise users who who like their free wins. All right, can we all agree on this? So, we got the Royal King and he says they legit added Jack Black and thought we wouldn't notice. Yeah. Oh, the beard. Hold up. Look, look, look. So, the Royal King's beard is gray, black, gray, black, gray. Jack Black's beard is gray, black, gray, black, gray. That is like so good. You Yo, if they make a Squadbusters film, we need Jack Black to play Royale King. I am Royale. Okay, cuz I am Steve. I get it. It's that time of the month again. It's time for grinding 6,000 gems for two piñatas every day for the next 25 days. And then this is it, of course. Yes, Squad busters. Yeah, the piñata bank is terrible, isn't it? They should either make it a hero bank or they should make it so you can get hero points in the piñata bank to make it more fun to grind. And then there is I have everything maxed out in a week. We need new content. Can't please everyone. Uh I'm not maxed out actually. My heroes are far from maxed out. So, um not really worth the effort since the rewards for that is very low. Don't get me wrong. I used to do that twice a day as well before. Yeah, they should increase the rewards just a little bit. Which side are you on? Are you on the red side with fireball and blazing light or are you a chicken clone and coin stash user on the blue side? Well, I'm telling you right now, I am a chicken clone and coin stash user. Fireball used to anger me so much. It still it doesn't really upset me that much anymore, but it used to annoy me. People sleeping on Hogard. Hog hard is annoying. So annoying. Funny AF. When you push someone into another squad, it is so annoying to deal with. It's not even like that good. I mean, it's good, but it's just annoying. Well, that's me done with the game for a bit. All right. Well, this guy's upset with something. So, let's see what he's upset with. He's a Mortise user and he just destroyed someone, I assume. Yes. So, what's he upset with? I assume he's upset with killing bot lobbies all the time, right? cuz all the lobbies are always bots. So, I would assume that's what he's upset with. There's another bot. Yes. Yeah. And then he he got one tap. He Okay. I thought he was upset because every game in Squad League is like so many bots. But look, this guy the bot was on literally 0.1 health and then it look that guy was on full health. Full health. Boom. One tap. Oh god. Right. All right. Well, I actually found this post right here also saying, \"Finally, no more one-shot archer queen for players. We're aware of issues with the archer queen's ability, one-shotting some players, and also joystick needing improvements. Fixes for these are coming in the June update, so that will get fixed soon, don't worry.\" Another bug that's not that annoying for me, but a little bit annoying is when you've got a Mortise user who like throws his bats forward and then the tank follows, but the tank then has like 20,000 health. Do you guys know what I mean? That's like also annoying. But they don't say when is the June update. I hope next week it is soon. You know what? I'll give you guys a little leak right now. The June updates in June. I predict it. I So, this is from my video where you can now have the bounty event from today. And then he said only 8 days ago, I made a concept. Tell me what you think. And it's literally where you get 100 hero points and 1,300 coins. He like bang on predicted that. Look, 100 hero points in the official event. In his also 100. That was a very good prediction. That was like perfect. Squad busters Reddit after new quest rework. Be aware of Squad Busters players. We need to complain. Hold up. I think the new quest rework is good. Is there anyone really complaining about that? You now get three extra quests a day. That that that's not bad at all. That's good. Thanks for showing me the polar on the right. Is what? Oh. Ah, people are complaining about more hero points. I don't think so. Surely no one's complaining about that. It's a good thing. Circlass tier list. Yes, this is my tier list that I made not too long ago. We see Trader Leon tank medic and hog in the first place which is crazy because medic would not have been good a month ago and miner would have been in S tier and now he's in Dtier. I wonder what other units fell off. Let's see. Uh Bob had a tiny fall off. Doesn't the rating depend on the hero you use? He mentioned that. Yeah, exactly. Obviously my tier list is skewed to a royal king user, but I did say that in the video. Finally, medic is on top. Medic is high, so those drugs he gives do more than healing. Agree. I haven't noticed medic giving any extra advantage so far in 2.0. What is bro talking about? The medic is really good now. And then the final post for today. There should be lineup presets. And oh my god, do I agree what bro? Mummy queen, Mortise Royale King, Barb King, lineup five, lineup six, Mortis Royale King, lineup eight. Agreed. There should be different lineups that have uh different hero, the abilities, the the squad league stuff, and just like everything. But yeah, this is definitely something I want to see. Mommy Queen. Strongly agree. It would be really good. At least one lineup per hero. Yeah. No, this is good. I assume this is something that will happen though at some point. Anyways, that's it for today's Reddit video. Use code cards in the Squadbuster shop if you buy anything, please. And check out my last video on screen right here if you want to watch more from me. We're back again on the Squadbusters Reddit. But before we check that out, let's check out this post here saying, \"Squadbusters breaks revenue record this month.
