Without strategic depth or the feeling that skill actually matters in a game, it's never going to maintain the majority of its players for longer than a few months.

However, brawl then released many broken abilities and didn’t care about the meta. I don’t think we have had a balanced meta for literally 2 years, and I don’t see a balanced meta coming anytime soon. This has ruined the competitive experience for me and plenty of others, as they keep listening to the wrong audience. I played less and less since 2023 and I now basically don’t even play anymore.

True fans or hardcores will be loyal and so u should cater for them too. If u make it too casual there will feel no reason to grind. We saw this with brawl and that's THE reason it started dropping off a bit because it felt it was catering too much to casuals. But with the recent update I think its a perfect balance to catering to both. Games will succeed when u take care of both audiences.

Due to these issues, Squad Busters faced financial difficulties and a shrinking player base, which led the developers to decide to stop development and prepare to shut down the game, with a final few updates planned before closure in 2026. This decision allows the development team to focus on new and existing projects with better prospects. This explanation is based on official statements and community discussions about the game's challenges and the decision to cease active development by the end of 2025, with shutdown expected in 2026",

But still I loved game cause its not game for grinding or doing hardwork its was about just opening your phone play some matches and enjoy the , music , interface , colours and just thats it.

The game was dead for a short while, but it was for a VERY SHORT period of time. I played a few Supercell games starting from their beta stages including Clash Royale and Brawl Stars. I think the secret to success is: 1. Having easy progression mechanics in the starting stages of the game, when you are only starting to get the player base (for all successful Supercell games it has been really easy to max out an account in beta). 2. Having a complex enough gameplay like Clash Royale/Brawl Stars/COC. Boom Beach is a failure because the gameplay is easy mechanically. It is not complex enough. It is boring. This is the same problem squad busters had. The gameplay mechanic is just boring. It should involve skill. 3. At the same time the gameplay mechanic should be easy to wrap your head around, while being hard to master. Think of Clash Royale counting elixir and keeping track of the card cycle. Or think about mastering movement/aiming in brawl stars. Brawl Stars had the same issues Squad Busters had in its beta days, but they took their time to fix the issues before releasing the game globally. That's why (to my knowledge) Brawl Stars had the longest period of beta testing of all the released supercell games. They had many stupid mechanics that they got rid of before launching the game globally (having a limited amount of games allowed per day through tickets, portrait mode, tap to move/swipe to shoot, maybe some others that don't come to mind).

Automatic attacking, so you just had to focus on timing, movement, and smart decision making. The hectic chaos was also a large appeal. It was more or less, a 4 min game of controlled chaos that certainly had elements of luck. But there was skill involved. I don’t care for heroes. The additional abilities that require constant usage and aim is too much. It’s certainly one of the reasons I stopped playing BrawlStars, and I played that game for 5+ years. The troops are pretty much meaningless since they’ve been stripped of their abilities. They’re just there, and super weak. No excitement opening up a chest for a new troop. You’re gonna get what you already have. And then you’ll get exactly what you don’t have yet. It’s lame. The focus is less on “Squad” and all on the heroes. Along with limiting squad size overall, which I’m definitely not a fan of. The optionality to double, triple, or quadruple up on Barbs or Shellys, or whoever your favorites were. Or to play all farming. None of that really exists anymore. The new updated requires you to engage in combat early and often. I always played super aggressive, but patient on when to engage, and I loved stockpiling multiple Barbs, Shellys, tanks, etc. My gf loved to play with Mavis, Greg, Trader on the outside. Now, you can’t do either. You get your hero, and you must fight other heroes early, otherwise you’ll far too far behind. I played for about 20 min since the update. But I don’t find it fun. I hope they bring back a legacy version or mode of the game, but for the most part I don’t see myself opening up the game again. Everything addicting and exciting about 1.0 feels like it was stripped in 2.0. Makes me sad, but that’s just how I feel.",

We got no realistic compensation for them being taken away, there is no way to purchase hero coins with in game currency. The only real way to get larger quantities of them is by buying the gem pass. Most players who were using their coins to bump up their chests or buy characters aren't going to be able to to organically earn 250k which means real dollars will need to be spent. The biggest issue isn't the gameplay, it's not the style, it's not even the changes.

Not taking any input from their current player base is absolutely insane. They quite literally said \"tough sh*t\" to all of the players that actually enjoyed playing the game in it's current state without any notice. As a company that is a crazy thing to do lol. By no means was 1.0 without it's issues & faults, but most of the stuff that could have truly helped (more content, class balancing, remove random lineups, clan leagues, etc.) is still a glaring problem outside of the complete change of the game that has been presented to us. 2. The 2.0 update itself was delivered in a very incomplete state. Hammers and Tickets are still useless. The compensation we were given was terrible, especially for those of us that had ultimate versions Barb King/Archer Queen. The turbo system is still in a really bad place even after their attempts to make it better. Star points/chests are completely unusable at the moment, and coins are mostly useless unless you want to pay up your chests for not getting 1st (which makes no sense for a large part of the player base with max'ed troops). Class balancing was completely ignored, there's even more useless classes now than 1.0. Hog rider has been replaced by Trader as the meta pick, which is even worse now because of how strong the rage spell is for engaging in PVP. While Squad Busters wasn't ever exactly what i would call a \"high skill based\" game, its even less skill based with spamable spells/skills that can chunk your health or even kill you at a distance. Worst of all, lets not forget the bugs. I'd love to know why they couldn't deploy an immediate hotfix for AQ 1 shotting, or Infinite Tank health with Mortis. It's actually crazy as those are bugs that 100% affect gameplay in the most negative manner possible and they are just letting it go until \"they're ready\". While I'm glad you and others enjoy 2.0, you have to understand why so many don't, and why those numbers are continuing to go down. I do appreciate your honesty and you're one of the few creator's I've actually seen give valid criticism of the new update. I can understand as a content creator or partner with Supercell, that's a slippery slope to traverse as I'm sure it always looks better if you constantly talk positive about the game. There is no way i can defend Supercell on this one, they half-assed this update so bad its inexcusable.",

Another thing is to make the squads like 1.0. no megas just 3 troops equals a fusion and let us have multiple of same troops. I say this bcuz now a lot of characters abilities are just spells and it feels we don't fully utilize our squaadies abilities like in 1.0 (it's a lot more passive now). Even after the balances the squaddies don't feel that important (at least actively and not just passively boosting atk speed for example).

They should return rewards from Masteries to Records 2. Give more Powerpoint to f2p players and proportinally to pay to progress (at leasy 2,000 powerpoints) 3. For people that have too many powerpoints, be able to sell them for gold (25,000 coins skins) 4. Events, events and events.

I personally got some Glowy Ore; Capital Gold, Gold, Elixir & a magic snack, which was good for CWL. - If you watched the YouTube videos about this new update (3 videos) you could've gotten 2x Clan Castle Cakes, 2x Mighty Morsel & 2x Builder Bites, great for CWL and some time reduction. - It's smart to drop this update during CWL as that way you maximize the active playerbase and also help those with those Magic Snacks for their attacks. I got 18/21 stars this month :D - No more trophy losses over farming is for me huge. I love to farm for loot with Sneaky Goblin armies so this is amazing. - Free gems for new achievements and the trophy leagues. It's great for players who already play this game for years & have a higher TH level to get a fair 3600 gems compensation. Bad things: - This update is so huge that they should've given more information than the information on the website. The videos explaining the changes also didn't give us all the details. - After you updated the game, there were 2 massive bugs: 1) your mobile phone crashed randomly or 2) you got a massive amount of Ore after a Revenge. - They should award all people some Ore for compensation of the Ore bug. This is unfair to most of the players and gives those who got them an unfair advantage. - They should've made the sign-up for your league maximim 4 hours instead of 18 hours. 4 hours is plenty of time and that way you can let people download the update & do some upgrades. - The maintenance break of the Ore bug took almost 2 hours instead of 1 hour without changing the \"Soon\". This is annoying and it's better to just give us \"1h\" than \"Soon\". - Why do you get put in a league based on TH first and then on trophies? I get it, you don't want players to drop down week after week but like if they want to push, let them.",
