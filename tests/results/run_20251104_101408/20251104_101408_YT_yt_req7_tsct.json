  "content": "So, a lot of people are very upset with Squadbusters right now. Uh, if you couldn't tell, even my comment section are filled with hate for the game. And if you scroll through the Reddit, it is a complete massacre of people's opinions on what they don't like. Some people are happy, some people are mad, and some people are sort of in the middle. So, today I'm going to be going over your guys' opinions, and then I'm going to be going over my opinions as well at the end of this video. Anyways, the most upvoted Reddit post this week is, \"As I thought, I'm out.\" as I thought. In my opinion, this has nothing to do with Squad Busters 1.0. For me personally, it's a completely new game, completely new game mechanics, and it just looks terrible. It's a shame. I really enjoyed playing and loved Squad Busers in its original form. Have fun to all players, but without me. Yes. Uh, we're going to get a lot of this today. I don't think it looks terrible, by the way. Uh, it is very different. And I will say my original original opinion when I first found out about this update a while ago was like it was wow and then it very quickly went you know like it I I got very worried and then the more I played it the more I liked it and now I'm at a point where I like it but I do think there are some changes that can be done but I don't think it needs a reverting. We'll get to that in a minute. In my opinion they could have just changed the progression, added new characters and perhaps make this new way of playing a mode. I'm so disappointed. The game was good. it just needed content. While the argument that the devs would make was it wasn't good. They were struggling with retention of new players. A lot of us enjoyed the game. I mean, I've been playing it for a year. You've all been playing it for probably a year as well. But the issue was new players coming into the game. And that's what this update is designed to fix. At least from their perspective. Tips for Squadbusters 2.0. Here's an effective tip. Oh, and by the way, I'm going to be making a tips video very soon, so look out for that. Anyways, this Okay, his tip is delete the game, right? Okay. That's got 500 up votes. You chill, guys. Dude, delete Clash Royale. It reminds me of the last Clash Mini update. The difference is that this game is global, so we don't have to worry about it being shut down, but they literally took the squad out of squad busters. It feels like a halfbaked concept. Heroes aren't bad, per se. It's just how they reworked that in a pretty unpleasant way. Squad is dead. I am very disappointed. This update is terrible. Slow movement. Can't run away from attack. No spells. Okay, I'm going to pause you there. No spells. All the spells just got turned into hero abilities. There are still spells, but there's now three spells instead of one spell if you think about it. Uh, squad existence is based on a hero. True. So, no more comebacks. Horrible compensation. Star chest have been nerfed. Plaza rework looks dumb. Small squads, skill-based gameplay, need to relearn how to play. The devs literally removed every good component out of the game. If their goal was to pit themselves out of a job, they succeeded. I enjoyed the game very much, but this is not the same. I don't think the game can come back from this. And that has a lot of up votes. I don't think it's hard to come back in this game because the game will quite literally give you your entire squad back if you lose it. It will give you a bunch of megas. But I get what you mean. If you're like running away from someone, there could be two other players who just start throwing spells at you and you die or their abilities. They removed characters to sell them back to you. Yeah. So you Barb King, Royal King, Queen, and Mortis have been removed from you and in return you can buy them back. Although what I will say is they did give us a bunch of hero points and then also they gave us a bunch of other ultimates for the ultimates that we lost. You know, I have a 50/50 opinion on this. Half of me thinks the compensation was good. And by the way, the compensation was good. I now have every ultimate even on my freetoplay account. But the other part of me that I'm just a little bit annoyed that I can't grind hero points right now. I've been playing for 2 days a lot and I've gr I've gotten like a,000 hero points. Like come on, man. This update has ruined the game. There's a lot of this today, guys. I've been playing since day one of this game. I put countless hours into this, but after playing the update since it came out, it has ruined my whole experience. Running has become painfully slow and the squad dies in a second. Abilities have changed and all of those upgrades for other heroes I've done have been rendered useless. A real shame of a game I've really enjoyed playing. And all of these have so many up votes. Exactly how I feel. Slow, sluggish, and the troops bust easily. So, first of all, check out this post here that says, \"For those who are upset about movement speed, they're increasing movement speed.\" Yes, movement speed has now been increased. So, if you hold down turbo, you run quicker. And I'll admit, it is actually a lot better for me at least. I I do prefer the turbo speed now. But yeah, uh when it comes down to the squads dying easily, essentially, the way I see the game right now is it is about your hero. The squad I see as you build up a squad and then you lose it in a second of course because of abilities and then but when you open up the next three or four chests, they actually just give you all your units back if you haven't noticed. And they're all megas. So it feels like it's less about building a squad now and more about just getting into a fight, losing your squad, and then just getting your squad back like a second later and then going back into another fight. Uh which I understand that a lot of people don't like. I don't know. I'm I'm very 50/50. Even wet paper is more durable. Okay, my entire squad after a hero sneezes on them gone reduced to atoms. I assume the solution to this is just making your units a bit more tanky. But I will admit it is very different. Anyways, got a positive post. Thank you sir Claus and Vidalki. And then these are all the content creators for the other Supercell games. And this is just me and Vidalki in our own little corner doing Squadbusters content. Feel like you should have included Stormmy there as well. But yeah, also Stormmy is a great YouTuber and I saw Full Frontage getting back into the game, but yeah, no one's beating Circlas and Vidal Key. I would say Stormy and Videli are both like pretty similar in size. No, I feel like Storm is a little underrated. Stormmy really is great. He sounds so pleasant as he destroys people like oh that's very unfortunate that you would make such terrible decisions busted. While Circlas comes off as cocky, but I like him anyways. Okay, I would argue if Smi is saying, ooh, that's very unfortunate that you would make such terrible decisions. I would say that's the cocky part. I'm toxic. It's different. The community is weird. Sure, this update has problems like abilities dealing too much damage and turbo rework. But overall, it's way more sustainable than before. Of course, big updates like this require more polishing. Just trust the devs. They know what they're doing. They will cook with the June update. And this is actually a post I made this morning. And you can see this is what people were voting on if the update is bad. Meh. Can be good with changes or amazing. And I feel like most of us do think this can be good with some slight changes like obviously the turbo which has already gotten, you know, fixed, I think. And then obviously making hero points more easier to get. Maybe changing the health of squatties or heroes a little bit. Um but yeah, we want to control our character abilities. Now you can do it. Upset. It's Brawl Stars now. I mean, yeah, I guess it I guess it is a little bit similar to Brawl Stars. I do see the resemblance now. Definitely. Anyways, we're going to end off on a positive post because we know a new hero is coming to the game very soon. And we also know a collab is coming to the game very soon. And this guy thinks he knows what the next hero is going to be cuz the next hero is going to be a speedster hero. And if you twist the hero that they showed us, it sort of looks like Sonic, doesn't it? So, this guy thinks the next hero could be Sonic. And you know what? I genuinely I see it. I actually see it. And also, I remember Sonic doing a collab with a Minecraft server a while ago when I used to do Minecraft. So, they do do collabs as a company. So, there you go. Anyways, let's end off this video with my opinions on the update. So, of course, I am enjoying it. I streamed like 6 hours yesterday and I've been playing a lot today as well. There are some things that I do think need to be changed. Turbo, which has already been fixed, and then maybe making it so you don't wipe out an entire squad in two seconds. And then another thing that's important to me is making hero points less painful to grind. For some reason, we can only do six quests a day and then what? There's nothing else I can do. I would much much rather have like 100 quests I can do a day, but all the quests give way less hero points. Or just like infinite quests, but they give less hero points. or maybe add a refresh button that costs like 10,000 coins that give me six new quests every single day. That way I can just infinitely refresh my quest. It still takes time. It's not It's a good balance between pay to free to play, but those are my opinions. I think the update is good. I think it needs some changes. I think it's got potential to blow up the game. I'm seeing some people who are coming back to the game who are very positive about the update. I think we should give the game about a week before we really make some decisions. Anyways, that's it for today's video. If you disagree with me, uh, there, let me know in the comments why. I'll look at the comments and I'll respond to as many as I can. Check out my last video on screen here, though, where I maxed out the three new ultimates, B, Max, and Shelly. And also, I got my queen half maxed.",
