    "probably mckinsey should hire mckinsey to find strategic solutions to get out from this mess",
    "McKinsey will be fine. You know why? Companies don’t hire consultants to help make difficult choices. Companies (management) hire consultants to give a stamp of approval to decisions they want to make. There’s a reason why McKinsey consultants are mostly ivy and elite educated individuals. Having a group of Ivy League graduates affirming a companies plan gives it credibility. AI doesn’t have that credibility yet",
    "“A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision.”",
    "The title \"Is McKinsey losing its crown to AI?\" is partially misleading, and The Economist should be more honest about titles of their videos. The title it is not entirely accurate because the video presents AI as a potential long-term disruptor, even if it is not the main cause of McKinsey’s current slowdown. The primary competitive pressure on McKinsey right now is not coming directly from AI companies. The biggest near-term threat identified in the discussion is Boston Consulting Group (BCG), which has been growing faster and could overtake McKinsey in revenue by 2026. AI-focused firms like Palantir and even OpenAI are emerging as new competitors, but their disruption is still nascent and largely confined to AI-related projects. Why it is partially fair: AI is a significant emerging factor, and the speakers do discuss how it could erode McKinsey’s junior-level work, compress fees, and shift the industry back toward core strategic advising.",
    "You know... McKinsey should hire consultants to tell them to lay off thier employees and then give their executive bonuses.. I know a few guys that will do it for 40 million.... easy peasy...",
    "TL;DR - The hosts don't know (took 7 mins to get to that bit!)",
    "an ex-mckinsey friend started a company recently. She told me “well basically 90% of a consultant’s job is dooable now with AI. we’ll be doing that”",
    "Well I thought that the value of strategic consulting was that it’s able to collect information that is not publicly available i.e. you won’t find it on AI. So I don’t see how they could be replaced.",
    "There's only so many ways you can make a PowerPoint that says lay off all your American Workers and outsource everything to India or load up on H1Bs.",
    "Do you actually think that McKinsey didn’t see this coming? I’m sure that they are operating in the background",
    "It is debatable whether McKinsey has lost its potential to AI. However, as a writer, I am certainly losing my paycheck to AI. And currently shifting my career towards the service/tourism industry.",
    "Palentir provides solutions with an end result. Big consulting companies not the case.",
    "The argument that IA will eat Mckinsey's lunch can be applied to almost any other business. I don't think that's how the world works, they would find a more sophisticated line of work, as we have been doing for the last 200 years since the industrial revolution.",
    "Problem is that after a while people can statistically figure out that investing into consultants is the same as gambling",
    "Consulting companies are interesting that they tell you what you should be doing, but can't show you how to actually do it. The art is making it real.",
    "Hey!, I love this Q&A format and I'd love to be part of one of these! Im a mathematics graduate with a CFA and a Cambridge MBA alongside some buy side investment experience. If you ever want to do one fo these for Finance instead of Consulting, I'd be ready on hand!",
    "AI is changing the world of not just consulting but all the service industries",
    "After years of listening to Jason Palmer, it is the first time I've seen what he looks like. All too strange what just happened.",
    "you need to know what questions to ask, how to ask them in a sequenced and refining manner, and how to interpret and apply the AI model’s responses within the applicable domain… more in the management consultancy’s realm than a 25 year old data management software vendor and hype marketeer like Palantir…",
    "Ever heard of Quantum Black, McKinsey's AI subsidiary? They have been working on it before it became a buzzword. I think the company will adapt really quickly .",
    "it's a threat to consulting just as it's a threat to many fields, sure",
    "Corporates need to avoid responsibility, that's why they need consultants, period. PowerPoint decks are worthless and they always been bit they are a handy backup of a decision that has already been made, AI doesn't change that.",
    "the world would be a far better place if these jokes went away",
    "Poor analysis. Palantir isn't much of a threat. Their revenue increase must be due to defense contracts.",
    "Yes because that half baked tariff chart is a great example of an AI use case.....smh",
    "Saw a ton of hype around Nixorus, they are acting like it changed their whole life overnight. Decided to test it myself. It didn’t disappoint. Legitimately the first book about money that didn’t feel fake or watered-down. No regrets at all."
