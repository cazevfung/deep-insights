    "\"Have you tried prompt engineering your manager?\" : Instructions unclear, I got fired",
    "Layers upon layers upon layers upon layers ... Very usefull session, as always!",
    "Thank you IBM! Pls do more such videos! They breakdown complex topics and are easy to understand.",
    "Saw the face and was expecting something along beer brewing Cheers to you Martin",
    "Loved the ending ha. Thanks for such informative videos as always. Please keep sharing.",
    "I get your point here. But I see context engineering as a PART of prompt engineering. Not a separate thing. Thanks.",
    "Ur presentation is awesome. This briefs entire book of contents in to few mins",
    "Nice touch & important and relevant topic. Can you create one longer video and address the issues from wider perspective of Agents, MCP, Context Engineering, A2A, ... and how to combine it all?",
    "Your videos are the best you include fun along with knowledge in it. I just love to watch your videos",
    "Prompt Engineering = Writing text msg to LLM. Include info on role, examples, constraints to get better results. Prompt: \"Find the best restaurant in India\" can give results that are not very helpful to you. Refined: \"You are a travel expert[Role]. Find restaurants similar to Namaste[Example]. Price per dish less than 500 INR[Constraint]\" Context Engineering = PE(LLM) + Memory(preferences) + RAG(relevance) + StateManagement(step by step guidance). It enriches the input prompt making the results more personalised. Thank you for the easy explanation.",
    "Wonderful explanations, as usual, from Martin Keen. Graeme is a great agent, he deserves to stay all the time in Paris, France.",
    "Very clear. I have learned a lot from your videos. Thank you :)",
    "Excelente video for who already started with AI, but don't know yet the difference between prompt and context.",
    "Great breakdown. In my eyes RAG is such a blatant diversion from how agentic systems should actually perform.",
    "I’m officially a geek. I actually laughed at that joke at the end",
    "Nicely explained, thank you for the video! And you should consider prompt engineering your manager, hahaha",
    "Please do a good explainer on agent fundamentals with some simple use case",
    "Context engineering is such a game-changer; combining RAG, memory, and multi-agent collaboration to make AI smarter and more dynamic. If you want to level up your AI workflows, check out the session and learn prompt engineering too!",
    "I’d love to hear your take on Graph-Rag systems and how they might fit in. My current thinking is to use it as a secondary step to extract related information once you have the used rag for the base retrieval. I’m using it for temporal information across a series of events. Still not sure how nessecary it is, but experimenting and measuring output with different use cases."
