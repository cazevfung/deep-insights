    "Amazing. Thumbs-up of course. The part that got me the most was the throwback to language formats - JSON, XML, etc. The whole idea of prompt engineering was to be able to ask the LLM questions in plain English. If we go back to formats, however intuitive they might be (by the way \"intuitive\" is highly subjective), fewer people would be able to prompt because of the learning curve. Of course, not all people are trying to create agents. It looks like context engineering is for the time being geared towards agentic programming.",
    "1. In simple words, context engineering is just designing right notes/infos, in right structure to LLM on which LLM performs tasks. 2. Context Engineering evolved from prompt engineering as prompt engineering is relvant from small systems like chatbot where constant human interactions are needed and when it comes to AI agents it evolves to context engineering as while building we are not going to talk it continously we need to give it prior knowledge that have all the info what it need to do for it to work end to end 3. Models, Tools, Knowledge & memory, audio & speech, GuardRails, Orchestration 4. Context Engineering relates to this 6 components by making sure how these all working together in systematic and right time 5. 6 parts are: 1. Role 2. Task 3. Input 4. Output 5. Contraints 6. Capabilities & Reminders",
    "Context Engineering is used when building AI agents to provide possible scenarios for the actions to take when a user makes a prompt. Context engineering is an evolution from Prompt engineering that encompasses a series of scenarios to an AI agent",
    "Assessment 1 Context engineering: it is a technique to provide or design information or prompt for AI agent in right format at right time (RAG is good example in relation with time) Answer 2:It is actually prompt engineering but when we develop llm based applications or AI agents we have to design system prompts , personas, tool messages all things have a great relation with each other and it is very systemic, detailed and context riched It exists before but now it has become a proper study and skill as well",
    "Context engineering: It is about designing and building a dynamic system to an LLM with the right info at the right time to complete a task Context engineering is the practice of prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the different scenarios of a particular problem. For example, if you were building a product, you might ask the LLM to think through its product-market fit, identify target customers, and so on.",
    "Models, tools, knowledge and memory, audio and speech, guardrails and orchestration It gives the context what the tools are what's in the knowledge base, how to use them and so on",
    "Hey Tina I am new to this Ai stuff, but its really interesting and I like how you break everything down into easily absorbable chunks of info. great video!! Assessment 5:46 Ai Agent Components: Model, Tools, Knowledge & Memory, Audio & Speech, Orchestration. Context engineering teaches you how to use the components so you can create an AI agent.",
    "What a blessing this channel is, thank you for keeping us up to date with prompting",
    "A prompt used in a chatbot typically involves simpler, interactive back-and-forth conversation prompts. This is often what is called \"prompt engineering,\" where you craft questions or instructions to engage the language model in dialogue or to get specific responses in a conversational manner. These prompts are generally shorter, focused on immediate interaction, and iteratively refined during the conversation. A context prompt used in an AI agent is more complex and structured. This is part of \"context engineering,\" where you create a detailed, comprehensive prompt that acts like an instruction manual for the agent. It includes multiple components such as task instructions, tools usage, memory access, guardrails, and orchestration. This prompt often involves structured data formats (e.g., XML, JSON) and covers all possible scenarios and actions upfront because the agent operates autonomously to accomplish tasks without iterative back-and-forth interaction.",
    "Brilliant stuff! Your content has been a huge help with my bachelor's thesis on AI agents. Thanks a lot!",
    "I just realised I've been trying to context engineer without knowing it. Time to start learning and thanks for the video.",
    "What an awesome explanation, Tina! You not only know your stuff, but you are specially brilliant at explaining it to average people. Thanks so much!",
    "Q 1. Context engineering is the design of a structured prompt with the relevant system, data, accesses to the necessary tools and clear explanation to guide the LLM towards building an AI application.",
    "1. Context Engineering is the practice of designing and building dynamic systems that provide a Large Language Model (LLM) with the right information, in the right format, at the right time to accomplish a specific task. 2. Since prompt engineering is not really effective and cost saving for AI apps, we use context engineering for this task. 3. Model, Tools, Knowledge & memory, Audio & Speech, Guardrails and Orchestration. 4. To achieve the goal of Context Engineering all 6 components of it should work together. 5. Role, Task, Input, Output, Contraints and Capabilities & Reminders.",
    "Very well explained as it means we know not to waste time thinking about context when we have no intension to build an app.",
    "Very well explained Tina, you pack so much in short videos and speaks so fast that I have to watch is repeatedly",
    "This is a great condensed video on many levels! Thank you Tina. One thing I would have liked to see is that final phase of how the 'components' manifest themselves in n8n along with a live run of the agent and watch it appear in your notifications via phone. Still awesome condensed details that really drives home the complexity of engineering good agents.",
    "Aren't we all context engineers? Every day, I use JetBrains AI assistant with a local Ollama LLM and an MCP server for work. When I get a new codebase that has a bug with a time-sensitive fix, I go through the code myself but need some help finding other issues. The more context the LLM has, the better it is at saving time, so I don't have to work hard to save time.",
    "I'm a conversation designer, so this is 100000% what we do now as designers. Really resonating with context engineering as a term to describe what we do and how we approach design. Thanks for the explanation and awareness, Tina. Absolute GOAT",
    "Context engenering is all the instructions we need to give to an llm /agent (llm=layered under your ai app) and everything it needs to do ( every action it needs to tale for ex help ppl in billing customer service and give control to a human when necessary) U have to iterate when talking to an llm u give it simple prompts and keep it iterating until u get desired result ( as the famous mnemonics says tiny Crabs Ride Enormous igwanas) sp u give full context to the llm instructions dos and don't bc u can't iterate so ta da context engenering Tina thank u so much I watch all your videos and I don't mean this in a bad way but u give those mom vibes I can't control myself when I see you have uploaded a new vid I need to watch it",
    "My Quiz Answers 1. what is context engineering? It is giving a LLM the right prompt for a particular task. 2. How did context engineering evolve from prompt engineering? Because we can't iteratively chat with the LLM to get to the right result? 3. What are the 6 components of AI Agents Model Tools Knowledge and memory Audio and Speech Guardrails Orchestration 4.

    "Another video that has me wondering where I have been for the past year. Tech changes so quickly",
    "So excited whenever I see your notification. Thank you Tina for talking about context engineering. Well-explained, keep it up!",
    "Giving LLM the right info In the right format At the right time to accomplish a task Hmm, sounds like using \"wisdom\" to me Great video. Thank you",
    "Hi. I took Tina's AI Agent bootcamp, just wanted to say it's awesome! I've learned so much that I'm continuing to build on! I’m building a somewhat similar app that helps me find relevant job postings from specific job sites. I’ve added a JSON file that the Agent reads from. It contains examples of best postings I’ve found, and I keep adding to it so the Agent keeps learning what I consider good matches. I also included a simple feedback system: each post the AI outputs has a box next to it where I rate it from 1 (best) to 3 (worst). That way, the Agent can keep refining its results based on my preferences.",
    "Context Engineering: It sounds as if it's simply common sense and logic. Anyone with a good grasp of the English language and 5th-grade grammar could draft a fairly comprehensive 'prompt'. Assessing your needs and effectively communicating them (whether to machine or human) is the crux. A background in coding may be of help regarding the XML, but certainly nothing more than the basics should be required. However, I appreciate your video, and it has inspired me to learn more about the subject.",
    "You're GOOD! Thanks for the very clear definition and difference between the concepts, Prompt Engineering vs Context Engineering. Keep up the great work.",
    "When you mentioned all the different LLM models, and said you should choose the one that fits, my head spun 360 degrees as I don't think the general public knows anything about the differences between these models.",
    "Thanks for the videos. I have been slowly making my way through your content as I transition from the legal support field into a more hybrid role and a good background in AI is a necessity at this point in time. Keep up the great work!",
    "you are so right. i use this method for building prompts to use for my research on building new businesses. great work Tina",
    "Another great video in a long line of great videos. Excellent insights coupled to clear explanations.",
    "Adding in the differences between an AI agent and an AI workflow would help people. If there is a step by step deterministic process, it is an AI workflow. If an LLM is acting autonomously and determining how many iterations per tools then and only then is it an AI agent. 80% of use cases are AI workflows because they tend to work better and are cheaper to run per query",
    "It means a model as well as its components have to combined them in such a way that they solve a specific problem.",
    "I think your videos are really excellent. Very well done, you are an educator. Thank you very much! For readers, consider following just one person who excels in their field to avoid duplication and learn new teaching styles.",
    "Key points for quick navigation: Context engineering involves designing dynamic systems that provide large language models (LLMs) with precise information for task completion. It is particularly relevant for developing AI applications like agents, contrasting with simpler prompt engineering used for casual chatbot interactions. ️ An AI agent comprises six essential components: model, tools, knowledge/memory, audio/speech, guardrails, and orchestration. The analogy of a burger demonstrates that, like burgers, AI agents require specific components and an instruction manual to function effectively. ️ Complex prompts for AI agents require detailed, structured instructions to ensure proper integration of tools and resources for task execution. Strategies for context engineering include writing, selecting, compressing, and isolating context to enhance AI performance. Resources, including blog posts and frameworks, provide insights on multi-agent systems and best practices in context engineering. Context engineers must ensure shared context and manage implicit decisions effectively across agents for optimal operation. Made with HARPA AI"
