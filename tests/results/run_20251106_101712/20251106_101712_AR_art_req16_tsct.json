        "FACT: Vector similarity search identifies data points most similar to a query vector using mathematical distance metrics.",
        "FACT: It transforms text, images, or other data into numerical vectors for comparison.",
        "FACT: Common distance metrics include cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, and Manhattan distance.",
        "FACT: Vector search is widely used in recommendation systems, image retrieval, and natural language processing.",
        "FACT: The technique relies on high-dimensional vector spaces to represent semantic or structural relationships.",
        "FACT: Vector similarity search can be implemented using approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms for efficiency.",
        "FACT: It enables fast retrieval of semantically relevant results from large datasets."
      ],
      "key_opinions": [
        "OPINION: Vector similarity search is more intuitive than keyword matching for understanding user intent.",
        "OPINION: The effectiveness of vector search heavily depends on the quality of embedding models used.",
        "OPINION: Approximate methods sacrifice some accuracy for significant speed improvements.",
        "OPINION: Semantic search should be preferred over pure vector search when context matters.",
        "OPINION: Poorly trained embeddings can lead to misleading or irrelevant search results."
      ],
      "key_datapoints": [
        "DATA: Cosine similarity scores range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating greater similarity.",
        "DATA: ANN algorithms like HNSW and FAISS reduce search time from O(N) to sub-linear complexity.",
        "DATA: Embedding dimensions typically range from 128 to 1024 depending on model and use case.",
        "DATA: Vector search systems can process millions of vectors in under 100 milliseconds.",
        "DATA: Accuracy drops by up to 15% when using approximate search compared to exact search."
