  "content": "Document indexing is used for reports that contain logical\nitems such as policies, and statements. The report indexing is used\nfor reports that contain many pages of the same kind of data, such\nas a transaction log.\nContent Manager OnDemand provides two\nbasic ways to index data:\n- Each of the items in a report can be individually indexed on values\nsuch as account number, customer name, and balance. Content Manager OnDemand supports up to 128 index\nvalues per item. With document indexing, the user does not necessarily\nneed to know about reports or report cycles to retrieve a document\nfrom Content Manager OnDemand.\n- Each line in the report usually identifies a specific transaction,\nand it would not be cost effective to index each line. Content Manager OnDemand stores the report as groups\nof pages and indexes each group. When reports include a sorted transaction\nvalue (for example, invoice number), Content Manager OnDemand can index the data on the\ntransaction value. This is done by extracting the beginning and ending\ntransaction values for each group of pages and storing the values\nin the database. This type of indexing lets users retrieve a specific\ntransaction value directly.",
