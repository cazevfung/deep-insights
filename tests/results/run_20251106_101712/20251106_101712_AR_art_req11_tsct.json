But these tools fall short when you need real depth — multi-step analysis, complex synthesis, and actual research.\nThe solution? AI research agents — hybrids that merge conversational AI with autonomous web browsing, tool integrations, multi-step reasoning and multi-step actions. Yes, those already exist and they are real working and useful agents. Unlike chatbots, they don’t just react; they think (in a mechanical, step-by-step way, not in a “developing sentience” way). They break down problems, gather data, and analyze it like a junior research assistant with unlimited energy but perhaps still questionable judgment.\nThese AI Research Agents rather confusingly have been branded with the same name “Deep Research” across many leading AI players whether its OpenAI, X.AI, Perplexity or Gemini.\nIf you prefer it, here’s the video of the whole article!\nA prominent example is OpenAI’s Deep Research, built on its o3 model, which excels at tackling detailed research tasks. This isn’t just a chatbot spitting out text — it actively investigates, often taking 5 to 30 minutes to pull together detailed, citation-backed reports. That’s a long time in AI terms and it can cost a lot in tokens used, but the payoff is depth and reliability (well, mostly — LLMs still hallucinate, and we’ll get to that). Designed for professionals, these agents streamline workflows — whether it’s conducting market analysis, reviewing literature, or synthesizing regulatory data — by providing comprehensive, citation-backed results.\nSo how can professionals like us make use of these Agents?\nOne of the biggest benefits of Deep Research tools is boost in professional productivity. It takes sprawling, complex and manual research and boils it down into something clear, structured, and actually useful. For example, a financial analyst trying to size up renewable energy startups before making an investment call. Instead of drowning in Google search marathons, market reports, policy papers, and competitor data, they can offload the legwork to a Deep Research agent. In minutes, it compiles a well-sourced, structured report outlining key financial metrics, market trends, and risk factors — what would normally take days of manual analysis, served up in under an hour. And while you work on other tasks! You can simply confirm from the sources it gives you and you’ll have saved tons of hours of research and Googling.\nA marketing manager launching a new product can do something similar. Rather than cobbling together fragmented customer feedback, industry trends, and competitor strategies, they can have an AI agent sift through the noise, highlight emerging patterns, and deliver a concise, data-backed summary. That kind of speed means marketing teams can tweak messaging, adjust strategy, and capitalize on trends before the competition even notices them.\nOf course, like all LLMs, these Agents AI are not infallible — far from it. No matter how impressive these tools get, their insights still need human scrutiny. A Deep Research agent can accelerate the process, but it’s your expertise that decides whether the conclusions hold water.\nAmong these emerging Agents, OpenAI’s Deep Research clearly stands out…\nWhile OpenAI wasn’t the first to launch a deep research agent — Google’s Gemini Deep Research beat them to it — it is currently by far the most capable version we’ve tested. It also marks the first public exposure to OpenAI’s o3 model, the most advanced LLM yet across most complex benchmarks at the date of the recording. What sets Deep Research apart is its fine-tuned reinforcement learning: during training, the model was rewarded for finding accurate, relevant sources and completing research tasks effectively, making it uniquely customized for multi-step reasoning and structured investigation using web browser tools.\nBeyond pulling information from the web, Deep Research can also process documents, PDFs, and URLs provided by the user. This allows for deeper, more contextualized analysis, making it useful for professionals handling proprietary reports, regulatory filings, or academic papers.\nDeep Research is available to OpenAI’s $200/month Pro users, who get 120 research tasks per month — each one taking anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes, depending on complexity and 10 of these queries for Plus and free-tier users. So, it’s pretty limited unless you pay its price.\nBut if you were willing to invest $200 monthly for an organizational productivity boost, here’s how you would go about using it:\nThe first step is to provide Deep Research with a task request. We generally find more detailed prompts to get the best results, where you communicate as much of your own expertise about the subject matter as you can to direct the research. In our experiments, we found a few things extremely helpful.\nWe recommend avoiding vague questions and clearly state what you need. Attaching relevant files or spreadsheets to guide the research helps with context. You can also provide it specific URLs to search and ask it to prioritise sources on these websites, this helps although it won’t be entirely obedient! What also works is requesting a particular format, such as a report with sections or a comparison table. You can also use another LLM to brainstorm and optimize your prompt before submitting it to Deep Research. Remember, running a deep research is slow, limited and expensive, so you want to optimize it beforehand. It also means it takes time to generate outputs, so step away and wait for notifications. Finally, and we can’t stress this enough, verify results, as the tool may occasionally hallucinate facts or miss authoritative sources.\nOnce the Agent has been assigned a plan, it will request some clarifying details. Here, it tries to gather prompt details you may have forgotten to specify. It gets to work after you have replied with clarifications. It begins to search the web using OpenAI models and tools. Deep Research scours multiple sources, follows leads, refines its searches, and builds a logical thread of inquiry. It doesn’t just skim the surface — it cross-references data, applies multi-step reasoning, and even runs Python scripts for deeper analysis. If an interesting lead pops up, it adjusts its search dynamically, much like a diligent human researcher would. Unlike standard LLMs, which tend to work within a single query-response cycle, Deep Research iterates — refining its investigation and re-evaluating its findings as it goes.\nIn his typical exuberant style, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed, “My very approximate vibe is that it can do a single-digit percentage of all economically valuable tasks in the world, which is a wild milestone.” While we wouldn’t count on this just yet, we think this class of reasoning-powered agents is likely to progress LLM adoption and economic impact to the next level.\nThat said, AI isn’t perfect, and neither is Deep Research. Like all LLMs, it hallucinates, misinterprets, and sometimes fabricates details. Its reliability also depends on the quality of its sources, so blind trust is never a good idea. But here’s the key advantage: even when verification is required, it’s still significantly faster than researching from scratch. Deep Research can surface critical insights in minutes, pulling together key facts that might have taken hours of manual browsing and link-following. As long as you bring professional judgment to verify its output, it’s an incredibly powerful tool — one that lets you focus more on analysis and decision-making, rather than on the drudgery of searching for information.\nOpenAI isn’t the only player in the AI research space. Other companies are building their own versions, each with strengths and weaknesses depending on your needs. OpenAI’s currently performs the most in-depth research with full web browsing and the most customised reasoning model for this task.\nGoogle’s Gemini Deep Research takes a slightly different approach — it lets you modify the research plan before execution, which gives you more control over the process. Its integration with Google Search and Knowledge Graph makes it excellent for general business research and competitive analysis. However, it tends to be weaker on deeper analytical reasoning compared to OpenAI’s approach. It’s fast (usually under 15 minutes) and cost-effective, but not always as thorough.\nGrok-3 DeepSearch from xAI (available via the X platform, formerly Twitter or via Grok) is designed for speed and real-time research. It’s great for quickly understanding breaking news, industry trends, or fast-moving competitive landscapes. It also benefits from more real time information via x data. But the trade-off is depth — Grok is more like a high-speed news aggregator than a serious research agent. If you need quick insights, it’s useful. If you need depth, it’s limited.\nPerplexity Deep Research sits in the middle. It delivers well-structured, citation-backed summaries in just a few minutes — great for exploratory research or quick fact-checking. However, it struggles with more complex multi-step reasoning, making it less suited for deep analytical tasks compared to OpenAI’s agent. It’s a good balance between speed and depth, especially for professionals who need fast but reliable answers.\nChoosing the right AI research agent depends on the complexity of your task, your time constraints, and the level of depth you need. If you need thorough, well-structured analysis, OpenAI’s Deep Research is the best option. If speed matters more than depth, Grok or Perplexity might be better choices.\nSo, just to give you the idea of a broader landscape, we also tested out Grok-3 DeepSearch. We asked it to gather examples of publicly shared real-world Deep Research chats in different industries to share in this article. This tool was quite quick and benefitted from the access to x posts where we hoped some examples would have been shared.\nHere’s the Prompt we put in:\nReview use cases of OpenAI DeepResearch from professionals across Finance, Medicine, Law, Marketing, HR, Product Management and other Corporate functions. Summarise the example and provide links to the chatgpt chat.\nI put the full Grok chat and response in the description of the video.\nThe search was not entirely successful but returned some useful examples. Here’s just a small excerpt from it:\nUse Cases by Field:\nMedicine: Doctors, like Dr. Derya Unutmaz, use DeepResearch to create medical reports and analyze complex data, saving significant time and potentially improving patient outcomes.\nLaw: Lawyers leverage it for legal research, strategy development, and competitive analysis, such as summarizing legal rulings on specific laws.\nMarketing: Marketing professionals employ DeepResearch for competitive analysis, content ideation, and automating research, enhancing content credibility with sourced insights.\nHR: While specific examples are limited, HR professionals can use it for tasks like compensation benchmarking and researching employee engagement best practices.\nProduct Management: Product managers utilize DeepResearch for market research and technical deep dives, aiding in understanding market trends and competitive landscapes.\nUnfortunately, it only returned one direct link to a full public Deep Research report covering an example of using the Agent for market research for product management shared in Peter Yang’s Creator Economy newsletter. This very specific request would have challenging to perform using web search alone however and very often we can uncover very useful sources or nuggets of information with these agents we wouldn’t have found manually.\nTo wrap up,\nDeep Research Agents aren’t just better chatbots or hype agents; they represent a new way of integrating AI into professional workflows that we believe is there to stay. They shift AI from passive assistant to active research partner, helping professionals make smarter, faster, and better-informed decisions while leveraging the “inference compute” scaling that recently surfaced.\nUsed thoughtfully, these tools amplify expertise — not replace it. The best professionals will collaborate with AI, using it to handle tedious groundwork while focusing their energy on higher-level, strategic thinking. However, you may want to create some new workflows around source verification if you want to use this research as the basis of formal reports! Just remember to always double-check generations and use them as a tool, not a replacement for human expertise!\nTransform the Way You Work: https://academy.towardsai.net/courses/ai-business-professionals?ref=1f9b29\nMaster LLMs and Get Industry-ready Now: https://academy.towardsai.net/?ref=1f9b29\nOur ebook: https://academy.towardsai.net/courses/buildingllmsforproduction?ref=1f9b29",
