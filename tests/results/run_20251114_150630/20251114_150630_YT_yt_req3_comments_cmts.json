    "I learned more watching this video in the past 26 minutes and 10 seconds then I have in one year and a half on other platforms. To all of you serious about AI and your personal and professional lives, take this guy, Arthur Miner, seriously. You won’t be disappointed.",
    "I really enjoy your content — it’s a gem! I’m 19 from India, a designer with a strong interest in AI. I’d love to contribute to your work (no payment expected). Can we connect once?",
    "Awesome mate! Tell me, I love using AI and Ive learned a lot with you. Trying to start some side hustles but I get overwelmed and never finish anything. I work two jobs, but getting too tired, I want to create side hustles using AI. Is AI Master for someone like me?",
    "This is interesting information! Perhaps I’m just being a bit lazy about writing detailed prompts. It seems like crafting a good prompt could take me hours. I feel like I need to be an expert on the subject before I can write a detailed prompt, but the reason why I write a prompt is because I am not an expert. Does it make sense?",
    "I can't access the course material in AI Master. Is the system currently down with tech issues or is it just me? Not the start I was hoping for",
    "Sheesh, I was after content not a sales pitch. Wow. Calm down with the promotions",
    "Will take this serious when you learn how to spell Prompt 0:40. How to say you are a scam without saying you are a scam. Not buying crap from you. 191K subscribers and only 11K views and 14 comments. Someone needs to be reported for buying subscribers.",
    "Step by step is bullshit. Because at some time KLM lies to please you and takes shortcuts. No Good advise source",
    "This is just a fake people without any talent use them to sell them to prove they are the best without real knowledge on the real timeline.",
    "Hey man, I just came across your channel and I see a big opportunity for you to grow it really fast. I can help you manage that. If you're interested, drop me a way to contact you so we can discuss what can be improved."
