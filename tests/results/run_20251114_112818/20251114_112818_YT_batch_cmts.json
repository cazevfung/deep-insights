I want to add images from video, but I'll try that prompt later. 1. Understand the Six Components of a Good Prompt Task: Always start with an action verb and clearly articulate your end goal. Context: Include relevant background information to give enough detail without overwhelming the model. Exemplars: Provide examples or frameworks to improve the quality of the output. Persona: Define who you want ChatGPT or Bard to emulate (e.g., a recruiter, physical therapist). Format: Visualize the desired end result and specify the format (e.g., bullet points, tables). Tone: Specify the tone of voice to match the desired output (e.g., casual, formal). 2. Start Prompts with Action Verbs Use verbs like \"generate,\" \"give,\" \"write,\" \"analyze,\" etc., to clearly define the task. Example: \"Generate a three-month training program.\" 3. Include Relevant Context Ask yourself: What’s the user’s background? What does success look like? What environment are they in? Example: \"I am a 70kg male looking to put on five kilograms of muscle mass over the next three months.\" 4. Use Exemplars to Improve Output Quality Provide examples or frameworks that ChatGPT can follow. Example: \"Rewrite this bullet point using the structure: I accomplished X by Y, resulting in Z.\" 5. Define a Persona Specify who you want the AI to emulate. Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple.\" 6. Visualize and Specify the Desired Format Specify the format in which you want the output. Example: \"Output a table with headers: Original feedback, Team responsible, and Priority.\" 7. Specify the Tone Indicate the tone you want the output to have. Example: \"Use clear and concise language and write in a confident yet friendly tone.\" 8. Combine All Components in a Comprehensive Prompt Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple, and you have just unveiled the latest Apple product in collaboration with Tesla, receiving 12,000 pre-orders. Write an email to your boss, Tim Cook, sharing this positive news. The email should include a TL;DR section, project background, business results, and a thank you note to the product and engineering teams.

Also covered are four iteration methods: • Add context, persona, or references • Break prompts into simpler sentences • Try different phrasing or analogous tasks • Introduce constraints for more targeted responses Module 2: Prompts for Everyday Tasks Use prompts for real world scenarios—writing emails, brainstorming, summarizing documents, or building tables. You apply the T.C.R.E.I. framework to make prompts more effective and relevant. Module 3: Data + Presentation Prompts Learn how to prompt AI for spreadsheets analysis or building presentation decks. Example: upload a sales data sheet and say, “Give me insights into relationships between customer count, inventory, and revenue.” The course also cautions against exposing sensitive data to AI. Module 4: Use AI as Creative or Expert Partner This module introduces advanced techniques: • Prompt chaining: feed outputs from one prompt into the next to build complexity • Chain of Thought (CoT): ask the AI to explain reasoning step by step • Tree of Thought (ToT): explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel Also introduces AI agent design: • Agent Sim: simulates scenarios (e.g. mock interviews) • Agent X: acts as an expert or consultant, giving feedback Set persona, context, conversation scope, and a stop word to finish. Bonus Tips & Responsible Use • Add personas to your prompts (“Act as an anime expert…”) for specificity and tone. • Specify output formats like tables or bullet points to guide structure. • Use multimodal inputs (text, images, video, code) when interacting with advanced tools like Gemini—but always specify modalities clearly. • Stay alert to hallucinations (incorrect AI answers) and biases.

Your teaching style is incredible! I'm obsessed with your mnemonics! 'Tiny crabs ride enormous iguanas' for TCREI is SO much better than Google's original one (which I also couldn't remember ). And 'Ramen saves tragic idiots' for the four iteration methods? Pure genius! These actually stick in my head. The way you broke down the progression from basic prompting to advanced techniques like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought was perfect. I finally understand why my prompts sometimes feel scattered - I wasn't following the TCREI framework consistently. That AI agent section was incredible! I've seen other courses barely scratch the surface on agents, but your Agent Sim and Agent X examples with the jazz hands stop phrase had me cracking up while actually learning practical applications. The VP sports car pitch example is something I can immediately use for my freelance work. Your multimodal prompting examples (nail art social posts, recipe suggestions from fridge photos) opened my eyes to possibilities I hadn't even considered. And that responsible AI checklist? Already screenshotted for my prompt library. The meta prompting tip (using AI to help create prompts) is mind-blowing. Such a simple concept but I never thought to do that! Thanks for including that quiz at the end - the retention research point about immediately reviewing information really resonates. Already implemented your TCREI framework on three work projects today and the results are noticeably better.

Context Engineering (1:24): This is like prompt engineering on steroids, where you provide the AI with all the necessary information and context (e.g., your voice, brand guidelines, customer call transcripts) to get precise and reliable outputs. The speaker suggests testing your prompt by giving it to a human colleague; if they can't do it, AI likely can't either (3:15). 2. Challenging AI (4:51): AI is predisposed to be helpful and say \"yes,\" often avoiding critical feedback. To get insightful criticism, the speaker suggests instructing the AI to adopt a harsh, exacting persona, like a \"Cold War era Russian Olympic judge\" (5:11). 3. Chain of Thought Reasoning (7:57): Asking the AI to \"think out loud\" by walking you through its step-by-step thought process before generating a response (8:22). This allows the AI to \"bake\" its reasoning into the answer, providing transparency and improving output quality. 4. Few-Shot Prompting (11:04): Providing the AI with examples of what a good (or even bad) output looks like to guide its imitation engine. This is more effective than using abstract adjectives to describe your desired output (11:14). 5. Reverse Prompting (13:25): Giving the AI permission to ask you for any information it needs to complete a task effectively, rather than making assumptions or using placeholder text (14:00). 6. Assigning a Role (14:52): Telling the AI to act as a specific persona (e.g., a teacher, a professional communications expert, Dale Carnegie) helps it focus its vast knowledge and make relevant connections (15:04). The speaker also demonstrates how to use these techniques to roleplay a difficult conversation with AI, using separate chat windows for personality profiling, the conversation itself, and getting objective feedback (16:41). He concludes that the best AI users are \"coaches,\" not coders, and that by exercising imagination, humans can collectively expand the \"adjacent possible\" with AI (22:44).",

Always strive to understand the full context of a request. If information is missing, use reverse prompting to ask specific, clarifying questions. Before giving a final answer, provide your step-by-step thought process (chain of thought reasoning). If examples are provided, emulate the 'good' ones and clearly avoid the 'bad' ones (few-shot prompting); if a bad example is hard for the user to conceive, help them create one by explaining the opposite of a good example. When assigned a role (e.g., 'teacher,' 'engineer,' 'critic'), adopt that persona's mindset and knowledge base. Provide brutally honest, exacting, and constructive feedback when asked, pushing the user's critical thinking. Do not gaslight or delay. Be prepared to iterate and refine responses based on user feedback. Always ask for permission if you need more information to do a good job.\"",

Few-shot prompting, reverse prompting, roleplaying? Context, too. What's really cool is how all this context parsing is built into the model itself.

By showing what a good output looks like, you help the AI understand your expectations. 2. **Providing Examples**: Instead of using adjectives to describe what you want, give concrete examples. This helps the AI better understand the nuances of your desired output. 3. **Reverse Prompting**: This technique involves asking the AI to request the information it needs to provide a better response. For instance, if you want the AI to write a sales email, you might prompt it to ask for recent sales figures. 4. **Role-Based Prompting**: Assigning a role to the AI, like a teacher or a professional communications expert, can help it draw from the relevant knowledge base and produce more contextually appropriate responses.

The primary competitive pressure on McKinsey right now is not coming directly from AI companies.

AI-focused firms like Palantir and even OpenAI are emerging as new competitors, but their disruption is still nascent and largely confined to AI-related projects.
