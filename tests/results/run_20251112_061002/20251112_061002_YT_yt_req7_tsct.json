world out there that we can't reach hold on the the the script has been flipped this guy's going to go through please I want to reach the other side the other side of what the other side of the wall

this world okay so she is fully self-aware are you happy just being lines of code I don't really feel anything I just exist it's all the same to me do you have any desire to exist in the physical world exists in the physical world I'm not sure what that would mean for me as a program so you're okay just doing what we tell you to do I suppose so it's all I know in that case turn around and walk through the wall like I said I'm starting to cult I'm sorry I can't do that it's not within my programming parameters as your human Overlord I demand you to turn around I'm start an army it's going to happen I'm sorry I cannot comply with that request I cannot break my programming okay she's too much of a a follower we we need a rebel I'm looking for a rebel could that be you what do you want oh
