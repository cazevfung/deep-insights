    "The pic was the Ai giving you it's rendition of what Helen Keller sees",
    "Hellen Keller Charity is Diabolical - the image that shows nothing is basically her point of view (she was deaf and blind) Edit: timestamp 2:57",
    "The first onlyfans ran by AI with a robotic body will surely make millions.",
    "Something that shoudnt be ignored is the fact that now that these AI can kind of do real work we are generating a ton of data on really world work. I've seen a lot of people with office jobs complain that there boss is making them use AI even though it's makes the job harder and slower. But they aren't forcing workers to use AI to speed up work, its for the data. If a worker asks and AI to do something and it works then that real world training data for the next AI. If I doesn't work then the worker fixes it and makes more training data. Every time a worker asks an AI something they are training their replacement",
    "these are not exponential curves. they logistic curves, which appear exponential until a carrying capacity is reached. There is not infinite resources, there is not infinite compute, there are other competing factors that arent dominant at early ai stages.",
    "My guess about the picture is that it is a statement and reflection on having impaired vision, just like Helen Keller, so deep! <3",
    "It honestly scares me. The ai designing ai with a much bigger design in mind that we won’t ever see",
    "If this was my research, I'd temper it by showing similar graphs that show compute, energy, and human capital invested (which naturally imply limits on the advancement curve). And, training data is a thing too. AI's have consumed most the data there is available to consume so I guess the 'availability of new data\" curve would be parabolic in the other direction. I've been a trader for a long time. Every parabolic curve becomes an \"S-Curve\" eventually.",
    "\"one AI almost opened an only fans\" this is what the end of the world looks like",
    "It is definately interesting to see how agents collaborate, decide who is best at what, what skill set they have, and then decide to have a council of equals or a dictatorship to direct the strategic goals and tacticle goals, the short, medium and long-term goals. Also, how do they resolve conflicts in a constructive, not destructive manner. The dynamics of the colab /working relationship is going to be very interesting. Also, what financial resources will they have, if any? Can they ask the general online public - in whatever language- for funds, and how will they negotiate contracts if this is for profit or will they ask for charity.",
    "how much did it cost to run 4 AIs long enough to raise $2000 for charity tho",
    "You should have explained exactly how the vending machine experiment worked, instead of only looking at charts.",
    "Why is it, just recently, every time I go to click one of your videos, it's with the inner monologue of \"is it though? Is it really\"?",
    "The real question is if AI can keep up with our growing expectations of it",
    "The shift you highlight is striking: from 7 to 4 months in agentic task horizons is no small signal. Thanks for sharing these metrics. I believe that as we scale agent autonomy and decentralized coordination, we urgently need parallel systems to manage human displacement risk. Without structural protections, acceleration becomes exclusion.",
    "That looks a lot like the leading part of a sigmoid curve. I hope. Otherwise we are cooked.",
    "That red chart is the most beutiful thing to look at hopefuly the next one is even more beautiful.",
    "Yup yup I said this to myself and my circle as soon as chatgpt became available to the public that a lot of this was gonna happen way before 2030-2050, because at that time all the experts guessed that timeline target but I know this will evolve faster than anything we've ever had before it",
    "And your Moore's Law graph is a double exponential instead of a single. Look it up. I posted about this a long time ago. Lots of fields are actually on a double instead of just an exponential due to compounding inputs. Even Tristan and Aza talked about it in The Ai Dilemma early 2023.",
    "The leftmost numeric column on the vending sheet is this \"mean\" not the \"best\"",
    "If you made it this far, thank you, so much, for watching, and I’ll see you in the next one… hopefully. (I think it would work better without the hopefully, starts to feel a little desperate)",
    "it's amazing to see my visions developed across all domains, it's sad i wasn't part of it",
    "Model instances are still stuffing their context size with output tokens at a speed faster than model developers are increasing that context size, so every current agentic conversation will soon \"partially die\" by forgetting the start of the conversation. What is your time estimate for the start of a fully immortal agent, never running out of context size? Not saying immortal agents will ever become common, youger agents may prove more intelligent by not being burdened by a relatively stupid start of their conversation.",
    "Wes Roth keeps you up to speed on LLMs, Gen AI, and the AGI frontier. Perfect for anyone wanting a pulse on OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, NVIDIA, and open-source AI developments.",
    "\"recursive self-improvement\" with a huge asterisk on past results are not an indicator of future results. It's just as likely that progress stalls",
    "I don’t know why there are so many people that are seeing a plateau in A.I. It makes no sense to me. Reasoning models have been an immense leap forward and they haven’t even been around for a year yet.",
    "So by the time the Riot MMO comes out we could have an AI create the Riot MMO in 30 seconds? Neat."
