    "her voice sounded way more natural than other in game AI's so far, really good",
    "2025 and not only do we still not have flying cars, we can't even smell Stella.",
    "This is the type of stuff I thought we would have in 2040",
    "Will they all say \"It's not just X, but Y\" in every single sentence?",
    "Lol what would have been interesting is if he said sniffing is how my people recognize distress calls",
    "she responded really well. it feels authentic and natural for a simple NPC in the game. I’m excited for the time when we'll have 3-4 npc AI companions joining us on adventures, traveling alongside, engaging in genuine, dynamic conversations with each other and us. add VR and online multiplayer and it will be totally next level open-world experience",
    "\"That's not how this works.\" If it were real life, it would be. You wouldn't be able to stop mustache. You would be a victim of the SNIFF.",
    "I saw this on the Neurosama stream. The technology is actually really impressive.",

    "Now the only thing it lacks is the feature which AIs play videogames in our place while we take a break and watching AIs playing videogames",
    "Imagine this technology in situations like negotiation and conversation segments in the Deus Ex series.",
    "that's so natural wtf but why he can't sniff Stella though, is it a bug"
