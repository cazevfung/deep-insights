    "Team ChatGPT or Gemini? Lemme know down below TIMESTAMPS 00:00 I found the Perfect ChatGPT Formula 00:40 The 6 Prompt Components 01:39 Task 02:07 Context 03:05 Exemplars 04:28 Persona 05:18 Format 06:20 Tone 07:05 Example using the Perfect Prompt Formula 08:01 Good vs. Bad Prompt Outputs",
    "Figuring out the amount of context to give ChatGPT has been my BIGGEST frustration; appreciate how you broke this down",
    "Now I watched this video. Then I copied the transcript. I asked ChatGPT to rewrite it in a proper format and write the promts I wanted according to this training. The result is beyond perfect.",
    "The best video I ever watched on Prompt Engineering, Fed up with so many videos watching hours of content to find nothing at the end. Just in less than 10 minutes, You conveyed everything. I'm sold at 3rd minute itself. Best example of technical content. Sub'd now",
    "Wasted hours on prompt engineering courses on youtube and did not get anything i didn't know but your 8 minute video teach way more than any other video on YouTube. Keep up the good work.",
    "I love that you talk fast & get to the point quickly. Your use of humor & speed kept my attention and I appreciate this information! Thank you!",
    "1. Task : Start with an action verb. 2. Context: User background, what success looks like, and environment or conditions of user. 3. Examples: Provide examples of the best or real results. It learns very fast through examples. 4. Persona: Act like a ______. (Also add person famous for that). 5. Format: Tell the AI the right output format you want the answer in. 6: Tone: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style.",
    "Jeff is a super instructor. He presents detailed content in an easy to understand way, and makes it fun and approachable!",
    "I seriously love this, especially the \"tell it the feeling you want so that it gives you 5 tone keywords you can include in a prompt for ChatGPT\". I saw one somewhere where you can ask it to play devil's advocate so you can see debatable opinions/outputs for either decision making or stuff like that. The options are endless, which I absolutely love. Thank you! Also, I noticed that the examples (black screen with moving white dots and then the copy over it) are on the screen longer. Thank you!! Not sure why but it helps me take in and absorb the info easier. Love it!!",
    "The simplest solution is to ask ChatGPT what prompts are required to do a certain task. You'll never need Youtube again!",
    "I am one man show starting business soon. I have some involvement with ChatGPT, however now I need to step up. Based on Your video I am creating one page chart to stick on my wall to remind me each time how to build the prompt correctly. Thank You.",
    "Gemini AI: Jeff Su's advice is a good introduction to prompt engineering. It provides a solid foundation and some useful techniques. However, remember that prompting is an art, not a science. The best way to improve your prompts is to practice, experiment, and learn what works best for you and the specific task at hand.",
    "From Chat GPT elements that make a good AI prompt, here are the ones you usually need (others are optional refinements): Role / Perspective – Who should the AI “be”? (e.g., doctor, consultant, teacher). Task / Goal – What exactly do you want done? (summarize, analyze, explain, generate). Context / Input – The information the AI should work with (a passage, data, situation). Constraints / Format – Any rules for the output (word count, style, tone, list, essay). Audience – Who the output is for (kids, experts, general public). At minimum, you only need Task + Context. The others just make results sharper.",
    "Hey Heff Su. Really appreciate you being so professional and delivering top-notch work. Keep rocking it!",
    "Best guy I've found on youtube so far - he gets straight to the point, no fluff, love it!",
    "I wanted to learn prompt engineering so I checked lots of resources on the net, but none of them were as useful and helpful as this video. Thank you so much for creating it.",
    "Thank you sir It's my first time using Chatgpt and this video explains in a precise and concise way how it functions. Cheers from Cameroon 🇨🇲",
    "My advice to all parents is to ensure that your children receive a solid education from primary to high school. This foundational learning is essential for them to be able to effectively use tools like ChatGPT and other AI technologies in the future.",
    "Really great value in such a short video, Jeff! Context has always been the trickiest part for me but I've found that sometimes less can be more in the initial prompt. Additional context can always be fed in later on using the conversational interface :3 Also, congrats on 500k! I'm so happy to see how far your channel has come along I'm gonna make a prediction and say you'll reach 1mil by the end of the year!",
    "Key Takeaways for quick navigation: 00:00 The key formula for ChatGPT prompts involves six components: task, context, exemplars, persona, format, and tone. 00:59 The order of importance for the six components: task sets the goal, context adds relevant info, exemplars improve quality, persona shapes the responder, format structures output, and tone defines the writing style. 01:57 Task component: Start with an action verb, clearly state the goal, whether simple or complex, to direct the output effectively. 02:27 Context component: Provide enough background info for ChatGPT, answering who, what success looks like, and the user's environment to narrow down possibilities. 03:25 Exemplars component: Utilizing examples or frameworks significantly improves output quality across various tasks like resumes, interview questions, or job descriptions. 04:51 Persona component: Define who ChatGPT should emulate, like a therapist for workout advice, a recruiter for job-seeking prompts, or even fictional characters for creative fun. 05:48 Format component: Visualize the desired output format, be it tables, emails, bullet points, code blocks, or paragraphs to suit the task efficiently. 06:46 ️ Tone component: Specify the desired tone, whether casual, formal, enthusiastic, or specific feelings, guiding ChatGPT to match the writing style. Made with HARPA AI",
    "I've always found that MORE is better. I just keep going and really nail down specifics. Who, What, when, where, why, How, etc. and use (brackets around context) I set the stage at the beginning. Usually though Im building upon an existing chat.. and say \"i have a new project for you\" \"based on our previous discussions, projects, added files, and screenshot etc....I feel like the greatest lessons i've learned to get the best results with GPT is to really build on a prompt. Give feedback. confirm what was good, what was bad, ask for a group opinion (lots of ways to analyze, change, improve.... etc). \"assist me with responding/ (creating copy, blog, guide, hand out. or (insert).",
    "Hey Jeff, your breakdown of the prompt components for mastering ChatGPT and Google Bard is really insightful and actionable. It's clear that you've put a lot of effort into understanding and sharing these essential tips for getting the most out of these tools. I'm curious about the balance between providing enough context and overloading the prompt with unnecessary information. In your experience, have you found that there's a sweet spot when it comes to context? How do you avoid going too far and including details that might not actually contribute to the quality of the output? Thanks for sharing your expertise!",
    "A prompt is a specific instruction or query given to an LLM (Large Language Model) to perform a task. A task can be: Providing information, summarizing, analyzing, planning, reasoning, coding, generating, etc. Effective prompt engineering involves iteratively refining these instructions or questions to achieve a more accurate, relevant, or desired outcome from the LLM.",
    "p.s. Part 2, I asked ChatGPT to put the content of your video in a numbered list of all the actionable suggestions from your video. I now have it all in one place. I want to add images from video, but I'll try that prompt later. 1. Understand the Six Components of a Good Prompt Task: Always start with an action verb and clearly articulate your end goal. Context: Include relevant background information to give enough detail without overwhelming the model. Exemplars: Provide examples or frameworks to improve the quality of the output. Persona: Define who you want ChatGPT or Bard to emulate (e.g., a recruiter, physical therapist). Format: Visualize the desired end result and specify the format (e.g., bullet points, tables). Tone: Specify the tone of voice to match the desired output (e.g., casual, formal). 2. Start Prompts with Action Verbs Use verbs like \"generate,\" \"give,\" \"write,\" \"analyze,\" etc., to clearly define the task. Example: \"Generate a three-month training program.\" 3. Include Relevant Context Ask yourself: What’s the user’s background? What does success look like? What environment are they in? Example: \"I am a 70kg male looking to put on five kilograms of muscle mass over the next three months.\" 4. Use Exemplars to Improve Output Quality Provide examples or frameworks that ChatGPT can follow. Example: \"Rewrite this bullet point using the structure: I accomplished X by Y, resulting in Z.\" 5. Define a Persona Specify who you want the AI to emulate. Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple.\" 6. Visualize and Specify the Desired Format Specify the format in which you want the output. Example: \"Output a table with headers: Original feedback, Team responsible, and Priority.\" 7. Specify the Tone Indicate the tone you want the output to have. Example: \"Use clear and concise language and write in a confident yet friendly tone.\" 8. Combine All Components in a Comprehensive Prompt Example: \"You are a senior product marketing manager at Apple, and you have just unveiled the latest Apple product in collaboration with Tesla, receiving 12,000 pre-orders. Write an email to your boss, Tim Cook, sharing this positive news. The email should include a TL;DR section, project background, business results, and a thank you note to the product and engineering teams. Use clear and concise language and a confident yet friendly tone.\"",
    "I think one thing that has helped me (as a prompt engineer on the side) is a principle I learned while doing research in physics - set your boundary conditions. This is implicit in setting an environment, but I think worth stating explicitly. If you can tell GPT what the boundaries are on some context/environment X, then it'll give you an even better response.",
    "Code Signal uses a very similar structure to yours: Ask, Context, Constraints, Example and Style. They call their system Markup Prompting Framework. Surely a Persona would help even more, so great video!",
    "Your formula simplifies a complex process. Also, kudos on the clarity and energy in your videos – it really helps.",
    "This has just been the best should I say the shortest yet impactful course, that has greatly enhanced my understanding of prompt engineering and how to effectively use ChatGPT . Thanks a bunch Jeff",
    "Outstanding presentation enjoyed the energy. Instant subscriber! I am learning to streamline the process to create an effective/ profitable digital marketing business process with the assistance of this tool. I think this is THE best place to start understanding how to use it most efficiently. Thank you!",
    "This is very streamlined and easy to follow. I will pass this video along to associates who are having a hard time navigating chatGPT",
    "I was doing this with prompts without even knowing this method. Now that I know it, I can actually understand why my prompts don't give me what I want and how to fix it. Before, I'd just try to add more information when I wanted to fix my output, but I'd get results that are going in a completely different direction than what I expect.",
    "I really love the way you talk fast and get straight to the point — it makes the video super engaging! Your mix of humor and quick delivery kept me interested the whole time, and I genuinely appreciate how clearly you explained everything. Thanks so much for sharing this valuable info!",
    "Excellent presentation. I found this out too. The key components here give you a higher quality result. I've found that breaking it down is helpful. I will ask if it understands or sometimes I will give it context, then an exemplar and ask it to respond \"read\" and only \"read\" so I don't use up memory. That allows me to load in content. I've found it does better with preloading it with context and exemplars then giving it a task after that.",
    "I just finished this video and I really want to thank you for this simplified explications I was struggling finding courses I even enrolled in one and it wasn't the best experience ever I even doubted my learning skills I thank you again it was so helpful and clear",
    "I've definitely come back to reference this video several times. It has a great breakdown and provides examples - which is my learning style. Thank you for sharing this information.",
    "You helped me to understand prompt and I’m really happy that you are here for helping people to understand",
    "Thanks for the video, Jeff. Concise and useful tips as always. It looks like ChatGPT can use strikethrough text. So when using it for correcting texts (6:15), you can ask it to strikethrough the corrected words instead of deleting them, so that you don't have to hop between the corrected version and the original version."
