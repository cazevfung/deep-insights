  "content": "I have to talk to you about video games. So, you you were being a bit trolly. I I think you're you're having more and more fun on Twitter on X, which is great to see. So, guy named Jimmy Apples tweeted, \"Let me play a video game of my VO3 videos already.\" Uh, Google cooked so good playable world models when spelled we n question mark. Uh, and then you quote tweeted that with now wouldn't that be something? So, how how hard is it to build game worlds with AI? Maybe can you look out into the future uh of video games five 10 years out? What do you think that looks like? Well, games were my first love really and doing AI for games was the first thing I did professionally in my teenage years and and was the first major AI systems that I built and uh I always want to have I want to scratch that itch one day and come back to that. So, you know, and I will do, I think, and um I think I'd sort of dream about, you know, what would I have done back in the '90s if I'd had access to the kind of AI systems we have today? And I think you could build absolutely mind-blowing games. Um, and I think the next stage is I always used to love making all the games I've made are openw world games. So, they're games where there's a simulation and then there's AI characters and then the player uh interacts with that simulation and the simulation adapts to the way the player plays. And I always thought they were the coolest games because uh so games like theme park that I worked on where everybody's game experience would be unique to them, right? Because you're kind of co-creating the game, right? Uh we set up the parameters, we set up initial conditions and then you as the player immersed in it and then you are co-creating it with the with the simulation. But of course, it's very hard to program open world games. You know, you've got to be able to create uh content whichever direction the player goes in, and you want it to be compelling no matter what the player chooses. Um and so it was always quite difficult to build uh things like cellular automter actually type of those kind of classical systems which created some emergent behavior. Um but they're always a little bit fragile, a little bit limited. Now we're maybe on the cusp in the next few years, 5 10 years of having AI systems that can truly create around your imagination um can nar sort of dynamically change the story and storytell uh and make it dramatic no matter what you end up choosing. So, it's like the ultimate choose your own adventure sort of game. And uh you know, I think maybe we're within reach if you think of a kind of interactive version of VO uh and then wind that forward 5 to 10 years and you know, imagine how good it's going to be. Yeah. So, you said a lot of super interesting stuff there. So, one, the open world built into that is a deep personalization the way you've described it. So, it's not just that it's open world like you can open any door and there'll be something there. It's that the choice of which door you open in an unconstrained way defines the worlds you see. So some games try to do that to give you choice. Yes. But it's really just an illusion of choice because you only uh like like Stanley Parable game I recently played. It's it's it's really there's a couple of doors and it really just takes you down the narrative. Stanley Parable is a great video game. I recommend people play that kind of uh in a meta way uh mocks the illusion of choice and there's philosophical notions of free will and so on. But uh I do like one of my favorite games of Elder Scrolls is Daggerfall. I believe that they really played with a like random generation of the dungeons. Yeah. Of you can step in and they give you this feeling of an open world and there you mentioned interactivity. You don't need to interact. That's a first step because you don't need to interact that much. You just when you open the door, whatever you see is randomly generated for you. And that's already an incredible experience cuz you might be the only person to ever see that. Yeah. Exactly. And and so but what you'd like is a little bit better than just sort of a random generation, right? So you'd like uh and and also better than a simple AB hardcoded choice, right? That's not really uh open world, right? as as you say, it's just giving you the illusion of choice. What you want to be able to do is is potentially anything in that game environment. Um, and I think the only way you can do that is to have uh generated systems, systems that uh will generate that on the fly. Of course, you can't create infinite amounts of game assets, right? It's expensive enough already how AAA games are made today. And that was obvious to to us back in the 90s when I was working on all these games. I think maybe black and white uh was the game that I worked on early stages of that that had the still probably the best AI learning AI in it. It was an early reinforcement learning system that you you know you were you were looking after this mythical creature and growing it and nurturing it and depending how you treated it, it would treat the villagers in that world in the same way. So if you were mean to it, it would be mean. If you were good, it would be protective. And so it was really a reflection of the way you played it. So actually all of the uh I've been working on sort of simulations and AI through the medium of games at the beginning of my career and and really the whole of what I do today is still a follow on from uh those early more hardcoded ways of doing the AI to now you know fully general learning systems that that are trying to achieve the same thing. Yeah, it's been uh interesting, hilarious, and uh fun to watch you and Elon obviously itching to create games because you're both gamers. And one of the sad aspects of your uh incredible success in so many domains of science like serious adult stuff. Yeah. That you might not have time to really create a game. You might end up creating the tooling that others would create the game. You have to watch other others create the thing you've always dreamed of. Do you think it's possible you can somehow in your extremely busy schedule actually find time to create something like black and white? some some an actual video game where like you could make the childhood dream come become reality. You know, there's two things way to think about that is maybe with vibe coding as it gets better and there's a possibility that I could you know one could do that actually in in your spare time. So I'm quite excited about that as a as that would be my project if if I got the time to do some vibe coding. Um I'm actually itching to do that. And then the other thing is, you know, maybe it's a sbatical after agi has been safely stewarded into the world and delivered into the world. You know, that and then working on my physics theory as we talked about at the beginning. Those would be the two my my two post AGI projects. Let's call it that way. I I would love to see which game post AGI which you choose. Solving uh the the problem that some of the smartest people in human history contended with. So P equals NP or creating a cool video. Yeah. Well, but they might but in my world they'd be related because it would be an openw world simulated game uh as realistic as possible. So, you know what what is what is the universe? That's that's that's speaking to the same question, right? MP equals MP. I think all these things are related, at least in my mind. I mean, in a really serious way, like video games sometimes are looked down upon. It's just this fun side activity. But especially as uh AI does more and more of the difficult uh boring tasks something we in in modern world called work. You know video games is the thing in which we may find meaning in which we may find like what to do with our time. You could create incredibly rich meaningful experiences like that's what human life is. And then in video games, you can create more sophisticated, more diverse ways of living, right? I think so. I mean, those of us who love games, and I still do, is is is um you know, it's almost can let your imagination run wild, right? like I I used to love games um and working on games so much because it's the fusion especially in the '9s and early 2000s the sort of golden era maybe the 80s of of of game of the games industry and it was all being discovered new genres were being discovered we weren't just making games we felt we were we were creating a new entertainment medium that never existed before especially with these open world games and simulation games where you were co-create you as the player were co-creating the story there's no other media uh entertainment media where you do where you as the audience actually co-create the the story. And of course now with multiplayer games as well, it can be a very social activity and can explore all kinds of interesting worlds in that. But on the other hand, you know, it's very important to um also enjoy and experience uh the physical world. But the question is then, you know, I think we're going to have to kind of confront the question again of what is the fundamental nature of reality? uh what is the going to be the difference between these increasingly realistic simulations and uh multiplayer ones and emergent um and what we do in the real world. Yeah, there's clearly a huge amount of value to experiencing the real world nature. There's also a huge amount of value in experiencing other humans directly in person the way we're sitting here today. But we need to really scientifically rigorously answer the question why. Yeah. And which aspect of that can be mapped into the virtual world. Exactly. And it's not it's not enough to say, \"Yeah, you should go touch grass and hang out in nature.\" It's like, why exactly is that valuable? Yes. And I guess that's maybe the thing that's been haunting me, obsessing me from the beginning of my career. If you think about all the different things I've done, that's they're all related in that way. The simulation, nature of reality, and what is the bounds of, you know, what can be modeled. Sorry for the ridiculous question, but so far, what is the greatest video game of all time? What's up there? Well, my favorite one of all time is Civilization. I have to say that that was the the the Civilization 1 and Civilization 2. My favorite games of all time. Um I can only assume you've avoided the most recent one because it would probably you would that would be your sabbatical that you would disappear. Yes, exactly. They take a lot of time these Civilization games, so I got to be careful with them. Fun question. And you and Elon seem to be somehow solid gamers. Uh is there a connection between being great at gaming and and uh being great leaders of AI companies? I don't know. I It's an interesting one. I mean uh we both love games and uh it's interesting he wrote games as well to start off with. It's probably especially in the era I grew up in where home computers were just became a thing, you know, in the late 80s and 90s, especially in the UK. I had a Spectrum and then a Commodore Omega 500 which is my my favorite computer ever and that's why I learned all my programming and of course it's a very fun thing uh to program is to program games. So I think it's a great way to learn programming probably still is and um and then of course I immediately took it in directions of AI and simulations which so I was able to express my interest in in games and my sort of wider scientific interests altogether. And then the final thing I think that's great about games is it fuses um artistic design, you know, art with the the the most cutting edge programming. Um so again, in the '90s, all of the most interesting uh technical advances were happening in gaming, whether that was AI, graphics, physics engines, uh hardware, even GPUs of course were designed for gaming originally. Um so everything that was pushing computing forward in the in the '9s was due to gaming. So interestingly that was where the forefront of research was going on and it was this incredible fusion with with art um you know graphics but also music and just the whole new media of storytelling and I love that. For me, it's this sort of multid-disciplinary kind of effort is again something I've enjoyed my whole my whole life.",
