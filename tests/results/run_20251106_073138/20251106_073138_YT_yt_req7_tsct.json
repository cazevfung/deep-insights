  "content": "AI could replace all game creators within 50 years. It's a scary thing to hear, right? Yokotaro, beloved creator of the NIA series, warned us precisely that, that all game creators could become unemployed within 50 years due to AI leading them to bet like BS. Listen, video games as we know it are an escape from reality, a shared experience, if you will. You can go to social media, your friends, your family, even a total stranger, and have some familiar memories and experiences to share with each other. Maybe you beat the final boss of Elden Ring, or you approach the emotional climax of Kingdom Hearts. Just those two are core memories developed throughout playing video games. And the ability to share those with other people is what makes it so special. You get to hear about how other people tackled a problem that you might have had with the game. I mean, with Elder Ring, you see people using large great swords that are super slow and then other people use magic and have a much easier time, right? It's so fun to share that with other people. Now, what happens if those shared experiences instead are completely replaced by AI generated encounters that are different for everybody doing it? Is that something you'd enjoy? Yokotaro pose the idea of being able to generate different encounters and roots in video games. But is that really what we want for creativity, storytelling, and the very essence of video games to be left to machines? Or could there be a way to strike balance between human creativity and AI? Now, before you start thinking AI is all doom and gloom, there's real ways to enhance the gaming experience for everybody out there. if done right. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking ideas are already being explored. Obviously, nobody wants to see other people lose work and lose jobs due to AI taking over. But what if I told you that doesn't necessarily have to be the case. Think about this with me real quick. I want you to think about a scenario, and trust me, this isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Skyrim, yep, the same Skyrim that everybody knows and loves, already has a mod called Mantella, which allows you to speak to NPCs that utilize AI. Imagine you enter a busy city in Skyrim and you see a random NPC. In the game, you have two dialogue options that ultimately lead to the same end. Maybe a question asking how the NPC is doing. Hey, how you doing? I used to be an adventurer like you, and I took an arrow in the knee. An arrow to the knee. As soon as that conversation's done, that NPC is now pretty much useless to you. You've exhausted all the dialogue options. They're meaningless. Now, imagine that exact same scenario, but instead, you can type or speak to that NPC in any way you want, and they'll respond in kind. Now, yes, this is using AI voice over, and the grand consensus is that AI voice over is bad, but I do think there's a solution to this. AI hasn't really progressed enough to be able to show you this just yet. But these NPCs could have a range of emotions. One NPC could be tired all the time. One could be quirky, funny, one could be a loser. The list goes on and on. This all sounds great, right? And there is a way that this can be done ethically. At least in my opinion. I've spoken to voice actors before, and surprisingly, they're not all totally against AI. From my understanding, the main issue comes when people are stealing and using people's voices and personal identity without permission and without adequate compensation. This is a problem and one of the biggest fear mongers as to how AI could completely eradicate the human side of voice acting. And it's a pretty reasonable worry right now. There are definitely ethical and practical ways to do this though. And I really do think if a voice actor is okay with the game company using their voice for AI purposes to train up a model, if they're compensated fairly and give full consent written into a legally binding contract that benefits both parties, then everyone feels like a winner. We, the consumer, get more in-depth immersion, better storytelling, more options, and the other side's happy as well, right? The important things are transparency, appropriate respect, and compensation. Instead of just letting AI take their jobs, I'd rather them be comfortable with how it's being used and profit more from it. I mean, I'm all for voice actors making it a better living wage. I think the current standards are set really low for voice actors. Sadly, AI could reshape the future of gaming in incredible ways, but only if we get it right. If we focus on ethical practices and careful regulation and ensure the voices of creators are getting heard, AI might not be stealing jobs. It might be enhancing them and allow all of us to experience a new future of gaming. But if it's not done right, we might lose the very heart of what makes gaming special. Now, there is also the fact that AI is a lot of the time completely misunderstood. While generative AI is the kind that creates brand new content like voices or storylines is often seen as a threat, the reality is the majority of games use different types of AI already. For example, simpler AI models that are used to enemies react to you in certain ways, make NPCs respond after certain dialogue choices are made. These systems aren't about replacing creativity. They're about enhancing gameplay. Obviously, there's caveats to this. AI is really not that advanced yet, and you would need very strong restrictions on things like what characters can and can't say. A voice actor obviously wouldn't want no restrictions so that the character could say literally anything and paint them in a bad light. And while AI could revolutionize how we interact with the world, it's really important to recognize the potential dangers. From 18 plus deep fakes used to manipulate people, AI generated influence, stealing content, promoting scams all across different social medias. The line between innovation and harm is paper thin. And on the flip side, AI is making great changes in the world as we speak. from the medical field using AI to solve diseases. Progress with things like cancer research and even climate change. And it's also used by so many people just to aid them in their daily jobs without taking their jobs from them. Think Chat GPT. Think artists who use AI programs and feed their own art willingly into it to speed up the creative process for them in the future. Your phone uses so much AI to translate things into a different language, show you algorithms that work for you for things like ads and videos on YouTube, even taking better photos. We interrupt this broadcast to bring you some breaking news. Did we see that even Elon Musk is trying to make an AI game? The same Elon Musk that keeps quitting his favorite game because he's apparently getting cyberbullied out of it and repeatedly dying to the first boss. I mean, this is just pure comedy at this point. He wants to make games great again by starting up an AI game studio. Now, I got to keep it real with you guys. If anyone is going to ruin gaming with AI, it's probably going to be this guy. It's an absolute joke and a travesty among gaming culture to be honest. He has the money and I think he's really smart when it comes to certain things, but this is a guy that claimed that he was in like the top 1% of Diablo players at one point and people found out that somebody else was playing on his account. Every time I'd actually streamed the game, he looked like he had no idea what he was doing. We also have Microsoft making a brand new AI game. And honestly, I'm going to let you all decide what you think about this. I'll let a clip play and you tell me. And in the comment section here is something I really personally resonate with and I think you'll too. Ignat says, \"Honestly, I do not want AI to make games. What I want is AI used to make the world feel more alive, more believable and natural interactions between NPCs and generate unique voices for random guards and bandits. That's what AI should be used for, not for the creative part.\" Which ties back to what I said before. I think if AI is used for voices with the voice actors permission and they're getting paid great amounts, then I'm all for it, man. If you just go on YouTube and type in AI content creator, you can already see that it's like best AI tools for YouTubers. And some of these things are quite useful, man. I mean, you've got chat GPT to help you come up with like title ideas or even come up with an idea for a YouTube video and then you can go and make it yourself, right? But then you've also got channels like this where it's like how I use AI to automate content creation and they're pretty much automating every single step of the creative process. AI comes up with the idea. It scripts out the entire video. AI creates the thumbnail, edits the video, and posts the video. So, it's like the only thing you're actually doing at that point is sitting in front of a camera and reading things out loud. And there's some people who literally generate that with AI as well. We have countless YouTube shorts, faceless AI voice channels running rampant right now. YouTube shorts literally with like talent competitions with a guy changing into an animal. It's it's just crazy the amount of AI on the platform already. and how successful it is. Because let's be honest, people are just interested in seeing something new and cool. Apparently, Dan Co over here says you can go from zero to $1 million if you start a oneperson business with AI and it only takes 30 minutes. So, what are you waiting for, man? Just become a millionaire. I'm not saying there's a perfect solution to AI right now. And the caveats come because obviously AI uses a huge amount of resources and energy. So, sometimes it can feel like the better of a two evils kind of situation. But I do think the key to coexisting with AI is regulating it. Fairness and responsibility. We can't let the rush to automate everything take away the magic of human creativity. If we manage AI properly, it could help us craft a future of gaming that we never even imagined without it losing what makes gaming special. AI could replace all game creators within 50 years.
