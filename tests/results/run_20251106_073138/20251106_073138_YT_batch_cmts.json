I do not think it could consistently and believeably light a character in every conceivable environment.

Like in Cyberpunk 2077 they have ray reconstruction for denoising when using ray tracing/path tracing, which is basically a technology that uses AI (machine learning) to enhance things like lighting accuracy, reflection quality, reduce ghosting, etc. And I believe AI in video games should stay as just that, enhancers.

      "content": "Hi love the content. Here's what I hope for in G.T.A. VI: - Missions not being so linear. I'd like the freedom to be able to complete missions how I want to, like being undiscovered for example. Right now, as of G.T.A. V, we have no options within the most mission parameters but to be discovered, because the mission parameters demand us confront the bad guys. E.g. the mission where we have to chase that actor from the movie studios, right at the beginning, we could have just sniped him from distance instead of being taken on an arduous chase. But, sniping him gives an instant fail. We can only complete missions as Rockstar want us complete them. - Avatar capability. When we run from cops, why can't we climb drain-pipes, clamber across buildings, and jump between them? We just end up ragdolling. - Better weapon control. At times, by the time we've retrieved weapons, and tried to turn aim and shoot. Whoever we're controlling, just has a spaz-attack and fumbles with his weapon as the screen rotates. Annoying as f. - Disguises. Why couldn't we use disguises when we chose to in G.T.A. V? It worked with the janitor disguise when we set fire to that building, and with the biker-cop disguise when we were chasing those two cars for Devon Weston, so why couldn't we dress up in hunting gear and fatigues, and go into Fort Zancudo? Theories: - I think that the Police and the Biker Gang are linked. I can't remember... was it a post card for Ambrosia that said something like 'The Biker Gang take car of everything else' We've seen that Jason has 'forces' history, a Ranger or something. What usually are professions that ex-service men go into? Police, Private Security, BIKER GANGS????? - I think that part of the plot of G.T.A. VI is going to be an investigation. In L.A. Noir we collected evidence as per investigations (C.S.I. sorta thing), in G.T.A. V, as players of the game we conducted investigations via external and in game materials, such as for the Infinite 8 killer. So what's the next step? An in-game investigation that's part of the plot of G.T.A. VI, which the character that we control are investigating? We already know that the police chief (or whoever it was) in Trailer 2 was corrupt. So, it could be an internal investigation into the corruption in the police department. Or, it could be an investigation into the links between the Police Dept. and The Biker Gang. Question: Why are their so many buoys in the harbour? Are they for ship navigation / harbour control? Are they placed specifically for in-game water sports? Do they mark underwater hazards? Do they mark shipwrecks/treasure locations? Do they mark where there are underwater activities?

I think npc would be present on spot holding his phone and as we saw news choppers exist too. They don’t need to use an invincible camera to capture the incidents but more of realistic perspective through devices of npcs. And sentient npc would be not fun at all for a game like gta, where characters like Jason and Lucia have their own voices and dialogues. It’ll be smart but upgraded over rdr2, the ai system. Like in rdr2 npc has literally routines, one seen farming will chill at night in the saloon or fight someone. Similar but more heavy ai looking at the budget… also gore would be so impressive I’m waiting for them to have chainsaw in the game",
