  "content": "CoSTAR Realtime Lab brings together world leading R&D expertise from Abertay University in games, design and development and Edinburgh University in the use of AI. We work together with UK games, film and animation industries to drive innovation in the integration of real time technologies and artificial intelligence into next generation production. We're currently working with multinational technology vendors, working with the other network labs. Realtime Lab will help to build a national network of innovators, producers and creatives that will help to make the UK a global destination for next generation production. CoSTAR Realtime lab is an incredibly exciting project to be involved in. The idea that the confluence of the latest technology and video games, the latest technology in the film and television industry coming together right here in Dundee and us being able to work in collaboration with Abertay on some incredibly exciting new technologies for use in that I couldn't be more excited to be honest. Similar facilities at Edinburgh College of Art will offer companies access to A.I. expertise and development of new tools and processes that embed artificial intelligence in production of next generation content. The facilities and the expertise will drive R&D led innovation into a commercialization pipeline, which will be managed by Interface, who operate Scotland's University Innovation Scheme and Codebase, who operate Techscaler a technology accelerator on behalf of the Scottish Government. I've been in and around the games industry for the past 25 years and watching games technology progress to where it's now being used as an integral part of major feature film production has been mind blowing. So to see that come on site here with CoSTAR Realtime Lab is incredible and it's only the beginning. You know I think the next decade of work, which is why this research project is perfectly positioned it's going to become even more important for producing some of the world's greatest content.",
