  "content": "today I want to show you some technology I've been experimenting with that I don't think is just going to change the video game industry forever I think it's going to change the movie industry forever I think it's going to change a lot of things forever and what I also want to show you today is how this system isn't just capable of being applied to video games you can also apply this system to real life over here I have an AI postprocess filter now I did a video the other day showing this technology with Unreal Engine but the craziest thing is you can use this filter for real life as well so if I want this to be on fire if I want this to be a ball of ice if I want this to be I don't know a ball of light I can make it all of those things but in reality it's just a drier ball now the longer you watch this video the crazier things are going to get and if you're interested in learning how to create create effects like this yourself you can join our Discord server link is down in the description but the thing is is as you all saw in my previous video AI video generation is getting to a point where it can run in real time the AI Minecraft game came out and there is no game engine in that it is just a realtime simulation of Minecraft running with a AI video generator and as time goes on we are going to see the exact same things being utilized just like this running in real time whether for video games or movies I don't know but all I do know is the more that I learn this technology and the more I experiment with it the more it blows my mind and I am going to show you a number of the incredible things that I have been experimenting with over the last couple of months so so let's start with one of my favorite things to show off which is fluid simulation I've done a whole bunch of fluid simulation videos on this channel if you haven't seen those go check them out and in Unreal Engine there's a number of different plugins and pieces of technology that people have made that simulate fluid dynamics and when I first started playing around with artificial intelligent postprocessors I was like man I wonder how far we could push this and one of the first things that jumped into my mind was I wonder if it can simulate fluid physics here is an empty glass as you can see there's nothing in it but when I run it through a postprocessor I can say hey fill this glass with water and as you can see now it has water in it now that's not particularly impressive but you want to know what is significantly more impressive let's say we have two glasses of water and if I have this postprocessor running I can literally take this glass glass and pour it into the other glass and I just want to remind everybody there is nothing in these glasses this is 100% a post-process simulation so just keep that in mind while you're watching this and the AI postprocessor actually understands that I am pouring water from one glass into another which is absolutely insane now naturally as a game developer when I started realizing what you could use this for I immediately started using games in order to create environments that you could apply these AI filters to and honestly video games are almost like the perfect thing to combine with AI postprocessors because you can control the environment you can do all sorts of different stuff but the more that I experimented the more I started to realize that these AI post processors weren't just creating pretty effects on some level these AI postprocessors were actually doing physics simulations and I started to notice this when I was combining generative AI models with Unreal Engine and here is a demo scene that I put together we're going to take this glass and we're going to use this camera to get footage of this glass and direct the AI to fill this glass up with whiskey and when we tell it to do that it will actually simulate the glass filling up with this volumetric liquid that it is pouring and I know that there's going to be some some people who are going to say oh it's just an effect it's just AI it's not actually volumetric fluid simulation but here's the problem with that statement the issue is for anything to create a convincing simulation or a convincing illusion of fluid dynamics or any kind of realworld physics that thing that system creating those simulations creating those Illusions in order for it to be able to do that it has to have it it has to have it would be impossible for it to do this without this being true it has to have at least some real understanding of actual physics and that is what I am proposing here I am proposing that a lot of these AI models that are now floating throughout the internet that we are training on video that we are training to give the ability for them to generate convincing realistic videos and now convincing effects like this I am proposing that a lot of these AI models are inadvertently in the process of trying to generate video I believe they are inadvertently picking up the ability to simulate actual physics I think we are inadvertently creating AI physics engines we have to be because this wouldn't be possible otherwise this right here is an AI generated effect this is something that maybe you could do in Unreal Engine maybe or Unity if you created a particle system that was really good but there's no particle system here in the same way that with AI Minecraft there's no game engine there is no particle system here there is no VFX system this is an AI model creating these flames on my hand and I would say they look pretty convincing don't you I mean look at them closely I mean look at this closely look at how the Flames work and this is also one of the issues that I have when people say that AI just steals footage from other movies or videos in order to create the footage that it creates because there might be someone that says oh well you know this effect this footage isn't real it's just stealing this from some other movie or some other video and then copy and pasting that work onto my my hand but you have to understand the movements of my hand are completely random it wouldn't matter what the AI was trained on it would not be able to create this effect without some kind of actual basic understanding of physics it wouldn't be possible so to wrap this video up I want to show some examples of this system being surgically applied to some actual gameplay and while what I am showing is still a rough prototype I still hope that it illustrates the concept because the way that you can use this AI isn't by affecting every single thing in the environment what you can do is you can create targeted effects that only affect one part of the body or one part of the environment and that is how I believe this will likely be used in video games or in movies going forward it's not going to just be one giant effect across the entire screen you can use AI to Target parts of the environment you could even use this inside of the game itself to generate something that renders in the 3D world but that single face or that Single part of the environment is actually generated so I hope you guys think that this stuff is interesting I hope that you think that it's impressive I certainly do it's one of the primary reasons that I decided to go to graduate school and study machine learning but I think more than anything this technology has the potential to allow more Studios to create more realistic environments than ever before with tool sets and workflows that used to only be accessible to huge big budget AAA corporations and now it's going to be accessible to everyone is that a good thing is that a bad thing well I guess it all depends on your perspective me personally the way I look at it is like this when you look at the industry is the objective of the industry to make money or is the objective of the industry to make the best product possible I mean in a way it's both but I would say predominantly the primary purpose of an industry is to make the best product possible for as little amounts of energy resources possible that is the name of the game and I think a lot of these tools are going to facilitate levels of efficiency where Studios will be able to create more hyper realistic games and movies for budgets that used to be virtually impossible and I would say for your average consumer who just wants to play Super realistic games and watch super realistic movies that are of high quality that's going to be a good thing and as you can see there's a billion different types of technologies that I could show in this video but I only have so much time and if you want to see all the other stuff that I've been working with and seeing make sure you subscribe I'll show that to you later but I think a really great piece of technology to kind of forecast the future a little bit is going to be this right here and I'm assuming that you probably believe that this entire time you've been looking at an image and what if I told you this is not actually an image what if I told you this is a 3D model that was captured from a real life camera this is a capture technique called gajan splatting and it's very very good at capturing photo realistic environments or assets that you can get using video or images just with your iPhone camera in fact most iPhone cameras now are more advanced than even the most advanced cameras for photogrammetry a decade prior so almost anyone now can go out and get gajan splat Maps like this that look absolutely photorealistic now the thing about gajan splatting is it looks good at a distance but as soon as you zoom in you'll start to notice that it breaks down and that's because gajan splatting is based on a point Cloud it's not a static mesh like most game ready objects that you see in video games that are highly optimized and performant this is a different system that's easy to capture from The Real World but when you actually load it up you're not going to be able to run a whole bunch of these in a video game without the video game crashing your computer and in order to convert something like this into a static mesh that is highly optimized and game ready typically you would have to hire someone to go through and do the very mundane repetitive task of taking this and converting it into a static mesh but let me tell you if there is one thing that AI is very good at is slightly technical yet very mundane repetitive tasks in the coming years probably the coming months you are going to get to the point where you are going to be able to capture hyper realistic assets from anywhere using your phone using anything with a sufficiently Advanced Camera and you will be able to capture all of the tiny details of that thing of that system in fact even these scans if you were to look at all of the tiny issues when you actually zoom in when we were showing the previous environment with a giant church right the tiny little details were kind of fuzzy but as you get closer you can actually get higher resolution images and higher resolution 3D models as long as you actually take enough pictures so this means that you could go in here and you could get all of the different pictures of these engine parts and all of these different things and it would be higher resolution AI is going to get very very good at converting assets just like this into a game ready 3D model now there are some things about 3D assets that take a little bit of creative work the topology the way you organize the mesh the way that you optimize it not just for the game but maybe even for other creators who are going to have to work with that asset as well those are things that require at least a decent level of creativity and a technical minded approach but as I've shown you with a lot of other things that is something that AI is progressively getting better at it is not just a simple automation system it has at least moderate levels of creativity and moderate levels of Technical mindedness and these kinds of tasks converting gajan Splat Maps into usable game ready assets is going to be absolutely huge in the coming months most likely when you look at games like Battlefield which have had huge teams dedicated to creating this massive photogrametry library for their video games those video games look photorealistic because of all of the work they did with those photogrammetry assets but the vast majority of Studios out there do not have the Manpower do not have the resources to take advantage of that in the coming years they will in the coming years you are going to be able to have indie games are going to be able to create quickel quality AAA quality photorealistic environments using scans from The Real World that they create themselves not even using assets from a marketplace with tools where you can convert real life gajin Splats or other kinds of scans into game ready assets using Ai and when that day comes I think we're going to see an absolute explosion of photo realistic game content is that a good thing is that a bad thing I don't really know it's really up to your perspectives on the matter but that is where this is all going so if you want to check this out if you want to check out the things that I've talked about if you want to learn how to do this if you want to get links to all of these gaj and splat Maps so you can explore this for yourself I will have our Discord Community linked down in the description that is our community where we focus on learning about all of this highly technical stuff uh I have a lot of people who I go to graduate school with who are in that Discord community and other enthusiasts so if you want to check that out links down in the description and if you think this is cool as I do make sure you subscribe and hopefully I'll see you in the next video all right take care today I want to show you some technology I've been experimenting with that I don't think is just going to change the video game industry forever I think it's going to change the movie
