  "transcript": "The AI resistance is building. I am  not just talking about people who are frustrated about slop or worried  about their jobs. It’s bigger than that. There are more and more people who  don’t like how AI is changing the world, period. Not because they think AI is  generally bad or because they’re luddites, but because we seem to be once again rolling out  a technology that works against our own interests. Staying well informed isn't easy, but we  recently got a subscription to The Economist, and I've never felt so well informed before.  They recently had a very interesting article, for example, about the astonishing drop  of immigration in the EU. Yes, you heard that right. Astonishing drop. I didn't read that  anywhere else. The Economist consistently delivers original reporting and they cover everything  from science to politics, economics, and global affairs without dumbing it down or hyping it up.  I myself prefer the print version, but of course you can read The Economist online or with their  app where you can find the digital version of the weekly print edition as well as short videos and  now longer video discussions with their editors, subscriber only podcasts and audio versions of  their articles, which is great for commuting or running errands. And of course, I have a special  offer. You'll get 35% off their subscription if you use my link economist.com/sabine.  And now back to the science news. The AI resistance is most visible on social  media. In January, Meta quietly pulled dozens of AI-generated Instagram and Facebook profiles, fake  personas like “Liv” the “proud Black queer momma of 2” or “Carter the dating coach”. The problem  was, real humans seriously hated them. Ironic, given that humans spend half their time pretending  to be someone else on social media anyway. Then, in March, meta rolled out AI  search features. But again many users really didn’t want this. Some used browser  extensions to hide the “Meta AI” feature, reddit was all over this. We have seen  this problem previously with Google’s AI search that so many people hated so much,  Google has now moved it into a separate tab. The issue isn’t so much the AI systems themselves. It’s that companies push them on  users who just don’t want them. Sometimes the backlash is quite funny. In  August, the American fast food chain Taco Bell rolled out an AI-powered voice ordering  system. People hated it and some took revenge. In one case, a customer ordered 18,000 cups  of water just to force human intervention. \"Hi, welcome to Taco Bell. What  can I get started for you today?\" \"Can I get 18,000 water cups, please?\" \"What can I get for you?\" Yes, so this was the more amusing side of  the AI resistance. But a similar thing is happening in earnest in coding. Some open-source  coding communities, like QEMU and libvirt, have explicitly banned AI-generated contributions. The  developer framework Cloud Hypervisor has adopted rules that forbid contributions generated by large  language models. So if you want to contribute code there, you have to do it the old-fashioned  way, by googling Stack Overflow answers. Ok, you could say, but really  the problem here isn’t AI, the problem is AI that doesn’t work very well.  But people don’t like AI even when it works well, sometimes exactly because it works well,  for example to produce digital art. This is why we now have art shows  popping up with No-AI requirements, like FanX or GalaxyCon. Some music venues have  banned AI-generated artwork even for flyers. The other day I had to sign a contract that required  me to confirm I hadn’t written my essay with AI. I fully expect that by next year they’ll  ask for proof of suffering as evidence. And this is just as well because the  International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers has recently  estimated that in the next five years, creators of music, or content in audio  and video, will lose about 21% or 24%, respectively, of their revenue to the  increasing market share of Generative AI. I suspect this is an underestimate because  a lot of creators will look for other ways to make a living, thereby further  increasing the GenAI-share. And yes, I am seriously thinking about what to do  when AI is good enough to take on science news. Maybe I’ll switch to cooking videos.  Sabine’s Cheese Channel, I can see it coming. But this was only on the software side. There is  also the hardware issue, the way that AI impacts physical reality. In the United States, multiple  towns and counties, from Michigan to Illinois, to New York, have refused to host AI data centres.  A similar resistance is going on in Spain, the Netherlands, ]Ireland, and France.. Much of  the concerns circle around use of land and water. So yeah, you know, that’s a problem the  singularity enthusiasts underestimated. That people just don’t want AI. Or  do they? Because here’s the twist: There are many cases where people  actually prefer AI to humans. One particularly relatable example is that  when people discuss health-related topics that they thought were embarrassing, they  preferred an AI chatbot. On the other hand, when people were angry, they preferred shouting at  a human. In retail, surveys show a similar split. Many consumers actually trust AI more than humans  to pick good outfits. And a recent study in healthcare found that patients rated AI-written  physician replies as more empathetic than human-written ones. The robots just care more. So what is going on? For one thing, customers are not generally opposed to AI,  they would just prefer to have an option. We have seen this here on YouTube as  well, with these AI generated language dubbing tracks. A good idea in principle.  In practice, people hated it because they couldn’t figure out how to turn it off. Which  is probably also how the AI feels about us. I am telling you about this for a deeper  reason though. Artificial intelligence has become an extremely divisive technology.  And I suspect that as it inches closer to human level intelligence this will become  worse. It is likely that we will see two extreme camps emerge. The tech enthusiasts  that embrace it, and those that reject it. The latter camp will make a business out of  human only spaces and products. In other news, I recently failed an “are you human” CAPTCHA. I’m  not sure what side of the rebellion I’m on now. Thanks for watching. See you tomorrow.",
