  "content": "This video is brought to you by Eric's Home. Stick around to the end to find out more. So, not long after my gushing review of The Altters, I started getting messages on Blue Sky to the effect of, \"Oh dear, looks like your recommendation of that game aged like milk.\" and a small amount of investigation revealed that it was getting heat for some AI created assets turning up in the build, meaning two two AI created assets, which was enough to start a social media backlash. Apparently, I found this very frustrating because I was immediately split. On the one hand, it's two [ __ ] assets, which according to the devs were placeholders that accidentally got overlooked in the typical mad scramble leading up to launch. All those people going, \"Ooh, using AI takes jobs away from artists.\" [ __ ] it was probably the artist who did it. I very much doubt it was one dude's entire job to make one wall texture and a background text asset. And even if you don't believe the line about them being overlooked placeholders, do you really want to throw the baby out with the bathwater over this? It doesn't change the fact that The Altters is a singularly good game. While playing it, I wasn't thinking, \"Boy, this game's okay, but I think it's that one wall texture and background text asset that really push it over the edge into a masterwork.\" No, it's a phenomenally well-designed game with a really engaging story. And it would still be that if you replaced all the textures with various colors of plaid. It's got many lessons to teach us on narrative game design. And frankly, if you boycotted over this, you're missing out on a lot more than it is. And frankly, I feel bad for the no doubt large percentage of people on the dev team who lovingly put it together and didn't even know about the AI asset thing. There was a famous tweet by Google's hastily someone called Stuart Neil that said, \"AI should be used to help creative people do tedious work, not tedious people do creative work, which I agree with. And the altter seems like a case of the former. Why bog the human artists down with making 14 slight variants on featureless cement wall textures when they could be drawing avatars of smiling puppies? The AI art police are getting a bit overzealous online. If you object to art assets not being human crafted, are you going to jump up my butt for using Photoshop's cloud render function to create a sky texture for Starruck Vagabond? Not current Photoshop with all the new AI [ __ ] mind. The cloud function in my ancient turn of the millennium era version of Photoshop I still insist on using and which continues to astonish me by still working in Windows 10. Do you complain about procedurally generated maps in Rogue Lights taking jobs away from level designers? Where is the dividing line of acceptability? Then again, do we believe the developers when they say this was only two placeholder assets they'd intended to take out? You know what they say, for every rat you see, there's probably 10 more in the walls. And besides, why would you use AI to create placeholder art in the first place? What's wrong with leaving it as a flat color with a few pixels scribbled on in MS Paint? Wouldn't that make it much easier to tell what placeholders still needed to be replaced before final release? And there are plenty of valid moral objections to letting any use of AI generated art slip by because the whole concept of AI generated art should be existentially terrifying to any human being who values culture. George Orwell wrote about novel writing machines in his book 1984. And I don't think he included it as an element of his horrifying totalitarian dystopia because he thought it was a really neat idea worth exploring. And let's not forget the environmental concern. Generative AI eats up a lot of power. Every time you ask chat GPT to summarize the school book assignment you couldn't be bothered to read, you might as well just light a tree on fire at the same time. And it's too easy to tell ourselves, \"Oh, two AI assets aren't going to cause much harm in the long run. But no one snowflake accepts the blame for the avalanche. We're at one end of a slippery slope.\" This is like when Diablo III was always online and Oblivion started selling horse armor. We complained, yeah, but we didn't complain enough. And now all that shit's been completely [ __ ] normalized. We're the metaphorical frog in the slowly heating water. If we don't pick on even the slightest use of AI in games, we'll all have our heads forced into the slop bucket before long. So, as I say, I'm split. My advice would be to play and enjoy the altars, but stay mindful of the AI thing and remember to make an at least equal fuss next time someone tries to get away with it, but I do sympathize with the devs. Not too long ago, I needed to script up one of my trademark irreferent incogns, and I was stumped for ideas. So, in a no such thing as bad suggestions sort of mood, I went to chat GPT and I asked it to write a 60-second ad for incogn style of Yatsi Crochure. Yeah, sorry trees. But you know what? The result actually helped because it was so [ __ ] god awful. It inspired me to take my job more seriously. The whole experience left me reassured that AI probably won't be taking my job anytime soon because AI can't handle the subtle nuances of humor. Comedy has no rules for AI to follow. Well, it's got one rule. Make people laugh. And that's a very primal, instinctive, organic thing. Why do we laugh at someone being hit with a frying pan the first time but not the second time? And why does it get funny again after 10 times? Let me demonstrate. I'm going to go to chat GPT again once more. Sorry again, trees. And I'm going to type write a 30-cond indictment of AI generated art in the style of Yati Croch. Let's see how it does. Here we go. AI generated art. the uncanny valley's landfill of mediocrity where soulless algorithms vomit out infinite variations of woman with glowing eyes staring into middle distance like a caffeinated tumbler with a paintbrush. Okay, I was with you for a while, Chad GBT, but where did women with glowing eyes come from? That's not going to have your audience nodding and laughing as they remember all their own weird personal experiences with optically luminescent females. I'd say that line was giving away more than a few personal hang-ups if it was coming from a person. And what the [ __ ] do you mean by caffeinated Tumblr? like a caffeinated Tumblr user or a caffeinated Tumblr the entire site. And why would having a paintbrush make this individual better at vomiting glowy eyed women? It's creativity without the creator. A spectral parody of human expression where nothing is said and everything is wallpaper. The digital equivalent of tracing with your eyes closed while screaming, \"Look, I made a thing.\" Boy, the fact that this came from an AI is adding more levels of irony than I can count. And it still doesn't sound much like me. There are so many missed opportunities to say something inappropriate. I just replaced tracing with something related to dorbing human [ __ ] onto the side of a horribly neglected racehorse. Yeah, that's how you do nonsequittors, [ __ ] No soul, no intent, just a magpie brain hoarding pixels and pretending it's a godamn artist. Congratulations, Skynet. You've learned to doodle. Okay, this definitely doesn't sound like me cuz I don't say godamn. I'd have said [ __ ] What's the matter, Chat GPT? You'll burn down a tree but draw the line at swearing properly. And that I think is my final takeaway from this. That chat GPT will never replace artists like myself because it can never craft nor understand the appeal of a really well-executed swear. It'll never know the joy of combining a one- syllable euphemism for penis with a two-cllable unrelated word with an asinent vowel and calling someone a [ __ ] forest. This video is brought to you by NordCurrent Labs for Eric's Home: The Stolen Dream, a new isometric narrative-driven stealth game set in the stunning town of the same name. Hannah's brother has gone missing, and her search for him sets off a chain of catastrophic events that will not only alter their lives, but also the destiny of the entire city. Switch between three unique characters and utilize their unique abilities to access new areas, overcome various challenges, and outsmart your enemies through the vibrant streets of Eric's home, a sprawling Nordic city inspired by the elegance and grit of early 1900s Scandinavia. And if you've ever lost someone in a busy IKEA during a holiday weekend, then you know the sense of urgency and terror, just like me trying to pronounce my glassing. Miglassing. Miglasing. Um, it's a duvet cover. Eric's Home: The Stolen Dream is available now on PC, Steam, and Epic Game Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. Heat up here. Heat. Heat.",
