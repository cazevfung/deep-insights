  "content": "This is an emergency distress call broadcasting from the planet Gaia. If you're receiving this, please respond immediately. Hey, can I sniff you? Uh, that's definitely not possible or appropriate. This is a distress call, not whatever that was. I'm Stella. Who am I talking to? Yeah, sorry about that. Can I sniff you later? Seriously, that's not okay. Can we please stick to the basics here? I need to know who I'm actually talking to. So, what's your name? And how did you manage to pick up my distress signal? You're right. I didn't introduce myself. My name is Mustache. I accidentally stumbled upon this signal. Do you think this device can transmit smells? You know, for sniffing mustache, seriously, cut it out with the sniffing comments. That's not how this works.",
