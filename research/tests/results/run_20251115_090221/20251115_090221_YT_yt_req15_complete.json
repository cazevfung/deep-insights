  "transcript": "good afternoon everyone i hope you're doing fantastic today in this video what i'm going to touch on is what exactly is a headhunter and what do they do so i want to take you back a few years before i do so initially when recruitment first started of recruitment agencies first came up i'm going back 20 to 30 years it was actually a very different model so it was a very local market so this is pre-internet and how recruitment worked is there would be a high street shop that people would walk into they would have a paper cv and they would hand it to the person and say they're looking for a job those recruiters would have existing clients that they would say look we've got these many people and they would offer the service out so it begs the question what would you do if you're a company based in london and you need someone in manchester you you could go to a local recruitment agency but they would only have the people that would be looking for a job and walking in so the clients you would have would be either from yellow pages so you'd call through the yellow pages and speak to people or you would have a rolodex of business cards that when you walked into prospective clients they would give you a business card and say this is the person to contact so what would you do if you need a really specialist position a chief executive head of development head of research what would you do so thus headhunters were born headhunters were people that in a nutshell would steal the candidate from their competitors that is pretty much what a headhunter does so now the modernization of recruitment with the internet linkedin you can pretty much find any skill set you want recruitment or head hunting has changed so it's gone from being a very specialist position where you could call up or you would know people so the original headhunters were actually very well networked people that could tap into high network individuals or people with a particular skill set so now headhunters have shifted from anyone can do it anyone can make fantastic and big money from you know where previously it was just who you knew so i for a fact can go on linkedin and i can contact the ceo of google or microsoft and i can potentially head hunt them so the market is open up greatly so recruiters it's leveled the playing field so if you want to become a headhunter where the skill set lies and what puts people off i've recruited for headhunting positions about twice i'll be honest like a real headhunting position where i've had to call people at work so i'd done one for a doctor and i'd done one for it was a head of legal for an oil and gas company so what i had to do it was a more detailed approach so i got to know the client i went and had actually had a meeting with them face to face i sat down they told me about the company they told me that i can only approach people from the 10 biggest companies in their sector so i couldn't go out to anyone and just bring them you know someone had the right experience they wanted industry insight into their competitors as well as the candidate they wanted to see how they can make their business better by going off after their competitors and so what i had to do very very uncomfortable i had to call up companies and ask to speak to that particular person i would have done my research before and i knew that was the person i had to speak to and i had to tell them apologies this is a cold call i may get you in trouble but blah yeah and it would be very confidential because you can lose them their job i could send them information via email to their work address which is potentially could be monitored so a headhunter's job is to do that there's other ways to do it you could pre-existingly have a relationship with that people now a good experienced headhunter which i am not a genuine headhunter not a recruiter because there is a difference would already have the relationship so you would be really specialist so let's say you recruit for neurosurgeons the top neurosurgeons and you was previously a director at a hospital so now you are headhunted that provide one or two introductions a year you're probably paid 50 to 100 000 pounds per placement so you can get a really big big fee i've heard of multi-million pound placements made and a thing that happens that you read on the news that this chief executive has moved from tescos to sainsbury's that was from a headhunter there is no way that person applied a headhunter built a relationship long term or had it and then found them the opportunity from that so it isn't the case of a recruiter that went to a recruitment agency or that person applied online headhunters built that relationship and they made the switch so you can wonder why specialists headhunters are really really in demand for big companies fees can be upwards of anywhere from 10 000 pounds all the way up to the millions believe it or not it makes up about six percent of the overall spend on recruitment services permanently it's pretty much only a permanent position as well so there's not much in a temporary market if you are interested in being a headhunter what i would advise is you must have at least five years experience in one sector you cannot do it by being recruiting for mechanics and then suddenly becoming a finance headhunter you need to have a lot of experience in that field before you actually go out and say look i'm a headhunter so your network is essentially what you're leveraging now linkedin has changed the market so if you want to actually become a headhunter and you don't want to follow my advice the dynamic has changed so you can be a mid-level headhunter so you could do specialist sometimes they're called executive search so it's really high salaried people executive search the general rule is any salary above 80 000 pounds would be considered an exotic executive position so what you want to do is you want to tap into that now commission wise if you are looking to work as an executive recruiter or for a certain executive and search firm probably you're going to be starting on a salary of about twenty thousand pound but you can chances are you probably make about ten to thirty thousand pounds if you're in the right company in commission this is where the real money is made in recruitment i prefer personally the high volume low margin recruitment on the permanent side but if you're looking to do one or two deals every few months probably you can take home a big chunk of commission it is really a dog-eat-dog road you have to really really work hard you are forever recruiting it is not a market where you can say oh i just want to do monday to friday you will be going to networking events you'll be meeting people you'll be constantly messaging people you have to have a really really good approach you have to have like someone won't engage with you even if they are looking for a job if you are not a higher caliber so for example don't look at your linkedin and they'll see you've had 12 jobs in the last six years they won't engage with you but if you've done a degree or phd and you've done you know worked in their sector before they're more likely to engage with you at times it is really about building that trust that network for these people i mean if you if you came to a hospital and you said i've got probably one of the top surgeons in the country they'll be likely to engage with you but not everyone can say that that relationship could have been forged over two to five years you could have wined and dined taking that person out you know sent them gifts um you know constituting the bribing essentially but you can actually build that relationship and that's how these things are done there is no way you can go on linkedin and approach high network individuals high caliber levels of staff with 20 30 years experience and just send them a quick message they're unlikely to engage with you and if they are they're going to engage with other people so their value isn't there so a headhunter's job is to find a real real value in the candidates that they can pitch and relationships are built it's ftse 100 i'm convinced every ftse 100 company every nasdaq company will have specialist headhunters in their phone their phone book so i hope you enjoyed this video i hope it's answered some questions it's a very interesting topic so if you've got any questions do let me know take care good afternoon everyone i hope you're doing fantastic today in this video what i'm going to touch on is what exactly is a headhunter and what do they do so i want to take you back a few years before i do so initially when recruitment first started of recruitment
