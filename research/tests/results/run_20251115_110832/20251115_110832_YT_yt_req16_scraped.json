  "transcript": "welcome today we're talking with uh brian epstein who is a career coach has been helping people for over 20 years to advance their career and get their dream job so brian welcome thank you very much nice to be here ken so why don't we start off because everybody's kind of wondering you know there's there's a career pregnant there's there's executive coaching and there's business coaching and there's career coaching and success can't even talk now success coaching so tell me what does a career coach do well a career coach is basically what it says it's helping people with all aspects of their career whether or not they're starting out right after college or university or they've just started at a new job or they're at a job for several years and they need help in managing their career or advancing their career i'm the person that will work with all of those people and helping them in navigating their career and looking for a career or advancing their career helping them with making a new resume a cover letter their linkedin possibly providing some career coaching so i will work with them in all parts of their career from the time they start their new job out of right out of university right up until they may be vice president of an organization and they need help in managing their team or working with some of their colleagues within the the organization okay great great okay okay so it's it's we're really from start to finish right so yeah up to up to the time they they retire sure so i work with people and i continue to work with people that are just out of university and they finish their degree or their college diploma and they don't know what they want to do even though they have this degree in their hands they're thinking hey do i want to continue to study more and go for more postgraduate work at university or to take some more training or education and college or do i want to look for a job right now so that would be one category people that are just out of college and university so let's let's start off with graduates so whether it's they're just getting out of college or they're just getting out of university you know they could go out and kind of get a job try and get a job on their own uh but why should they talk to a career coach first right and and how do you help them well i think a lot of people when they do finish college and university they have high expectations that they've just finished this program and now they're just going to be able to send in a resume and either they're going to get a job right away or they're going to be able to get into a postgraduate program so sometimes it's setting the expectations helping them in terms of whether or not advising them is this the time to maybe look for more education and if they're going to look for more education what are different alternatives that they can do with our different options some people are uncertain what they want to do so there's a lot of uncertainty for someone that's just graduating from college or university whether or not i should continue my education or should i start applying for jobs and even if i am going to start applying for a job um this graduate may say to him or herself how do i go about doing that i mean in the past people thought oh i'll just fire off a lot of resumes and hopefully something lands in someone's desk and i get higher but realistically to find a job it's it's a good idea to develop a good network doesn't matter where you are in your career starting out or more advanced in your career so i will help be the person that's just graduating from college or university to develop a good network and to be able to seek out opportunities by not just firing off resumes but but by having a very organized fashion a way to look for a job okay great so when they come to you the the you know let's say with all the all the graduates that you've worked with thus far what is usually their biggest concern when they come and see you confusion uncertainty what do i do now i have all this education but i don't know where i'm going to fit into the job market and who's going to want me with all this education and how do i make myself marketable for the the marketplace the canadian marketplace so that people don't just see me as someone who's just been in university or college all this time so i think a lot of these people who are young in most cases although obviously today we have people that go back to college and university at all ages but i i work with them to it assess their skills and their and what they have to offer organizations and try to find what their passions are so i'm i'm working with them they have someone who's giving them an objective viewpoint um supporting them through the whole aspect of finding work from the time that they start looking for work having someone that's going to be on their side guiding them throughout the whole the whole way so to answer your first part of the question there is confusion but my role is to help them to navigate through this confusion so that they feel more secure and looking for a job and they know where there is opportunity and there's where organizations might value their education and their background to this point okay great so there is i mean there's some people and they they just go out and they just grab kind of like the first job right that they right and it's not necessarily going to be in their career path so is that like one of the biggest mistakes or what are the biggest mistakes that graduates make at first when they're going out and they're they're applying and they're getting their first uh job opportunity i believe that a lot of people are not being um self-reflective enough and they're not reflecting on their own skills and experience and what they can bring to an organization and to actually write that down put it in a computer to look at it to have a good understanding what they have for organizations and to be able to match it up with or organizations might be interested that's one thing to have a good understanding a good reflection of an assessment of their skills and experience secondly i think young people or people that are just graduating from college university need to actually research the the marketplace and have a good understanding where organizations what organizations and what industries may be interested in their skills and experience and what can they offer what what what organizations will be interested in what they have to offer so i think those are the areas that um where new graduates could use the most support starting out obviously you do an initial assessment and whatnot and then after that what is it that you do like do you help them with resumes do you help them with networking just go through the other bag sure um well you mentioned already that i do help my clients with the assessments and help them with the research where to research what organizations they may want to contact within the canadian workplace and i do help the clients with their resume so i will look at the skills and experience that they have or their existing resume and then we will go back and forth i will provide some statements that they the clients may want to use on the resume but i would want them to provide it we have to work in collaboration with each other because only the client knows what he or she has done 24 7 for all his career so i would want him or her to share with me some of her his or her accomplishments what he's done in his career and to write it down and then i would start preparing some statements and preparing some statements targeted at the company that is looking to hire somebody looking at does this resume will this resume reflect upon this client in this candidate in the best way i will help him with his cover letter making sure that the cover letter stands out it has a good introductory paragraph talks about his skills and experience demonstrates that the client or the candidate knows something about the company or organization that he is applying for and demonstrates that this that i as a client or um or my clients will know hey i can i can fill the gap of what you're looking for in the organization i help them with their linkedin and a lot of people come to me and say oh well i just have to copy and paste my resume and put it in the linkedin and um more and more people are saying today that is not the way to make a good linkedin and if you want to have a narrative and talking about your skills and experience and using in a different format than you would do in a resume so i will help clients with that i will also help clients in coaching them for interviews a lot of us um are nervous when we go for interviews so i will want to help the client strategize and how to plan for his or her interview how to answer some of the questions i will practice with the client so that he feels confident and you can answer some of the questions i will talk about how to we will role play in terms of how to actually walk in to the interview and from the time the person walks into the interview and says hello to the receptionist until the actual interview until the end of the interview i want to practice all aspects of the interview with the client so the client will feel confident and will build that confidence and i want him to envision himself and visualize himself doing well in an interview because a lot of the time people feel nervous is because they have bad negative thoughts of how they're doing on the interview but if they took the time to visualize a positive way how they want to be in the interview they will demonstrate in the interview that they are confident and competent to do the work that the employer is looking for so all those aspects everything um including resume writing cover letter linkedin and and later on negotiating the right offer if an offer is provided and how to carry on that offer in a nice positive proactive way so that it's respectful to the employer that the client or candidate is looking for a job and in the end i also want to help and i have helped people to integrate into the workplace how to start off on the first day how to continue to demonstrate that i am a good employee and i can fit in into the organization because number one you may have the best technical skills in the world but if you are not able to demonstrate that you have good communication skills and you can fit into the organization many canadian employers will not be interested in either hiring you or keeping you for the long term so listen i think i'd like to kind of end uh just by asking just a kind of a more general question so if somebody's kind of stuck in their career you know they don't like where they are you know what tips you know what what kind of one one good tip or strategy could you give them that could help them to maybe advance their career i think number one they have to take reflect reflect upon their own skills and experience and determine what they have to offer and what other employers may be interested in whether or not it's their existing client their existing boss in the or their own organization or someone else within the same organization or another company what do they have to offer why would employers be interested in that and then number two they have to research the marketplace and determine what's happening in the marketplace where is their growth where would um other companies and industries be interested in the skills and experience that i have to offer if somebody's looking to get more information do you offer like a free consultation that they could uh take you up on for sure um anyone that's interested in my my work as a coach please give me a call or send me an email or me or there is a form on my website to fill out and i spent a half an hour with the client to to find out a little bit more about him or her gives him a chance to find out more about me and then we can determine if we have the right chemistry to work together as a coach and a coachee okay great well brian thank you very much for uh sharing all your wisdom today and uh look forward to chatting with you in future thank you ken and thank you for taking the time to talk to me",
