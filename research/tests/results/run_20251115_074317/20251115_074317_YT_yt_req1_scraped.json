    "When that guard said \"I'm doing my best\" I really felt that I'm ngl",
    "The NPC running underneath the stairs and saying \"My rod needs tending\" sent me",
    "The comedic timing by contestant number 3's \"I don't know any songs\" was perfect",
    "5:14 genuinely shook me, the way it finally thinks of a song in desperation to stay alive is WILD",
    "It was strange to hear that guard desperately try to stop Kevin from jumping off of a bridge lmao, he might be AI but that guard is such a homie",
    "\"Plagiarize? I would never stoop to such a thing!\" No one tell her",
    "Idk why but the line \"GET OUT OF MY WIFES HOUSE\" as he himself leaves is unintentionally hilarious",
    "“Always stay vigilant, always stay brave and always keep it real” - ya boi captain Aldis",
    "I absolutely love the fisherman saying \"lead the way\" and staying put like he's just trying to get rid of Kevin. Power move.",
    "When the Khajiit said \"I have a song in me\" I lost my marbles. It was so hilarious and fitting",
    "\"are you suggesting that the jarl's steward is... involved with a barrel?!\" killed me",
    "Kevin: can you give us a song to inspire us? Lurbuk: oh I'll give you a song Lurbuk: proceeds to drop the biggest banger of the 4th era",
    "The \"game show\" with \"sentient\" NPCs is literally the funniest thing I've seen this year. Keep up the good work.",
    "Gimli: \"I never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.\" Legolas: \"What about side by side with another soul you crossed paths with and had a bit of let's call it 'company' while the world tossed you about?\"",
    "That’s interesting that the guard knew part of his job was talking you off the ledge.",
    "6:00 I didn't realise anyone could make this mission more cold hearted, but making him hum for his life while you dance in your chair is hilariously dark",
    "Saying \"hold on lad/lass\" unironically whilst saying it's a bit harsh \"not being friends\" is next level",
    "I'm impressed that the AI seemed to figure out which one of the NPC's are contestant number 1, 2 and 3, reacting accordingly",
    "I like how the AI plays the NPCs like a D&D player playing a D&D character but not wanting to actually roleplay them in character.",
    "Contestant #1 wins by doing absolutely nothing this is bullshit i stand up for #2 a real one",
    "\"It's not everyday you get to spend a night with a vampire\" \"Play your cards right and you might to again because I'm turning into one\" Kevin that was GOLD",
    "10:58 \"yeah but the weather is nice\" \"t'is the dead of night friend\" that made me laugh way to hard",
    "\"I´ll steal his stuff...Oh no I said that out loud!\" Had to be one of the funniest things ever XD Like what an incompetent thief",
    "I’m so glad that captin Aldis finally decided to collab with Kevin. I hope Aldis’s streaming career will pick up after this!",
    "If this becomes a series that would be amazing. I need to gather my thoughts for a moment",
    "Since this mod came about, I've been saying that it would be brilliant if it was fully and properly implemented in an RPG. The idea of fully immersing yourself in a character and the world and interacting with the NPCS, it could make doing quests a whole lot more interesting if they could get the characters to adapt to what you are saying. People hate the whole AI thing, but when used like this. I think it would be amazing.",
    "I have to agree with Brutius, \"Company\" is absolutely one of the finest things to be vaguely connected to.",
    "i like that it took kevin all of seven minutes to turn into a batman villain",
    "Kevin freaking Thonnir out by telling him his wife and child died in a fire because Kevin got Thonnir and Hroggar confused. Like the poor man just had his wife get turned into a vampire and then killed, and is now having to deal with the trauma of killing his wife, even though he didn't, and him burning his child alive, even though his child, who is a son not a daughter btw, is fine. Like Kevin just straight up gaslit him into believing he murdered his own family and implanted false memories to back it up.",
    "\"My rod needs tending, My bait needs refreshing,\" me too bro.. me too",
    "\"gorm is not even a name\" says the guy who names his characters gorg and grognak and such lol",
    "\"are you telling me rhat the jarl's stuart is... Involved with a barrel?\" I'm still laughing"
