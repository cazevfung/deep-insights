  "transcript": "how we search for jobs has transformed drastically over the last two decades platforms like LinkedIn indeed in glass door are among the key players in online recruitment these companies have reshaped their industry carving out an$ 11 billion Market projected to grow to $41 billion by 2032 and in a survey of a th000 job Seekers 40% of respondents credit job search engines to securing an interview 35% say company websites are the way to go and 34% say Word of Mouth networking is the best way to nail down an interview but today the industry is more than just listing a job or networking to find one the rise of AI and evolving expectations from both employers and employees are driving hiring companies to new levels of innovation but just how are these companies adapting with new competitors coming to the market and how will AI play a role in our future Job searches indeed is one of the key players in an increasingly competitive market it's owned by recruit Holdings a Japanese Employment Agency with a market capitalization of $75 billion that's larger than some of Japan's biggest name companies like Honda motor and Nintendo indeed flexes as the number one job site in the world with over 350 million unique visitors every month in 2023 and it intends to stay that way leading the effort is Chris hams CEO of indeed who joined the company in 2010 as vice president of product hams credits the company's job first approach for building trust in its 20-year history we exist only to help people get jobs and I believe the most important factor in influencing how a company makes decisions about their products and their services is how they make money that's because indeed gives employers the option to sponsor a job listing with prices starting at $5 a day or $150 a month we only make money when we are helping an employer and a job Seeker connect which means that all of the data that we collect from job Seekers is used only to help them better match for the best opportunities possible they're going to find the opportunities they're looking for and they won't be finding themselves reached out for irrelevant things or targeted for advertising that's not why they came to the site in the first place inde DED shares a hiring space with other sites like LinkedIn which offers not only a constantly updating job board but also a space to network with other career focused professionals but hyim says this comes with a cost if you look at other businesses like LinkedIn an amazing company we have a huge amount of respect for them a portion of the revenue comes from employment they also make a huge amount of money from advertising and from sales and other things and so as a person who comes on to the site are you being targeted just for employment opportunities or for a whole host of other things but adding social media into the mix of hiring has been massively successful for LinkedIn in the 2024 fiscal year LinkedIn reported revenues exceeding $16.37 billion up from almost $15 billion in the previous year the platform boasts over a billion members in 200 countries and regions and has also ranked 116th on America's Most Innovative companies by Fortune linkedin's revenue streams include a significant contribution from advertising which generated $5.9 billion in 2022 meanwhile its premium membership surpassed 1.7 billion dollar as of March 2024 glassor also acquired by recruit Holdings has built a reputation for services that encouraged transparency in the job market Christian southernland Wong CEO of the job site emphasizes that glor's platform allows people to hold employers accountable particularly around pay transparency a critical issue in today's labor market at the end of the day it's transparency that's going to be the ultimate solve for a lot of pay inequity that we see in the US and around the world the platform's option to be anonymous has made it a popular outlet for employees to be honest about their employers and the anonymity has built trust and help prospective employees understand what really goes on behind the scenes at companies as of 2024 glor reports over 63 million unique monthly visitors and hosts more than 112 million reviews salary details and workplace insights the value of glassos platform is that we have trust with the people who use it and so we put in a ton of processes and a ton of investment in making sure that people can trust the platform without that trust we can't exist so we take it really really seriously despite their progress these companies like many others in various Industries have also faced layoffs in 2024 LinkedIn reportedly laid off about 200 employees from its engineering and customer support teams in May inded laid off around a th000 employees representing about 8% of its Workforce artificial intelligence has also become a focal point for job sites looking to utilize technology to improve efficiency recruit holding is investing heavily in AI the company's leaders tout this as a new era in hiring that will provide users with a personal talent agent powered by generative AI I see what AI can do is effectively take this kind of very white glob experience and make it available for the masses an agent could be on your side to take you through your job-seeking journey and make it a much smoother and more powerful experience for you as a job Seeker for indeed this approach to AI is also at the core of their strategy if you think about how a talent agent works for athletes and for musicians that is someone who understands everything about you about the market and who works tirelessly on your behalf this is one of the things that generative AI can actually bring we have the first versions of this that we are are going to be releasing in the coming months and we see a real future where every single person will have a champion just for them that is helping and working tirelessly to connect them to the best opportunities as the hiring landscape evolves platforms like indeed LinkedIn and glor aim to connect people with opportunities in smarter and more efficient ways AI is set to play a pivotal role transforming job-seeking promising agent-like chatbots to improve the experience for users but the question remains will AI be a force that better connects humans to jobs or will it diminish a number of humans needed in the workforce",
