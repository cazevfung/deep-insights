  "transcript": "He's a well-known comedian, actor, and podcast host, and his massive It Ain't Right tour is selling out shows all across the country. Plus, he has a comedy special that starts streaming on Hulu tomorrow. ABC's Ashen Singh caught up with Sebastian Maniscalo. During Love Making, I'm getting I'm getting Charlie horses. This Do you ever have this happen? Right. Right in the middle. I'm like, \"Oh god, get off. Oh my god, I can't I can't get rid of it, babe. I You're special. It's unbelievable, by the way. Thank you. It deals with the absurdities of society, from social media to getting older. I mean, Sebastian, what's grinding your gears these days? Uh, well, the special is called It Ain't Right. And as I look around, a lot of things ain't right. Here's one thing that's bothering me. People who wear Invisalign during the day. This should be at night, at night only. It's just I have a hard time not focusing on the saliva that gets caught between the the the the Invisalign and the teeth. So, yeah. I mean, listen, I made a living out of like uh talking about uh basically observational humor and things that kind of uh upset me. So, this special in particular not only deals with that, but like you said, getting older. I'm 52. I got a six-year-old and an eight-year-old, so I'm like an older father. And uh yeah, I'm just I'm just sore at the end of the day with the amount of bending that I have to do and I'm basically icing my knees at the end of the uh day. So yeah, it's uh I had a great time uh uh shooting this special in my hometown of Chicago. I'm looking forward to it airing on Friday. Yeah. You shot this special back in Chicago at the United Center. What was it like bringing the special back home? What did that mean to you? Yeah. So, it was my uh second special uh that I did in Chicago and uh performing at at home. It's just I don't know. It's very familiar to me. There's a lot of sarcasm in Chicago. Chicago really kind of uh molded me as a comedian growing up making fun of uh friends and whatnot. Even though when I go back to Chicago now, I get ripped to shreds. Right. There's Oh, man. I mean, there's no way I could have a big head with the amount of friends that I have that make fun of me. Uh, you know, they'll probably see this piece and go, \"Uh, what were you wearing?\" You know, it's it's just always just always a ra a razing we give each other. So, uh, it was great to do it there. Have my family there, my father, my my kids were there, my mother. Um, it was it was something special. You said before that you made the conscious decision to keep your material away from controversial topics and political issues. Do you think that uh hot button issues are something that comedians should avoid or is it just something that's not really your lane? Uh not my lane. I don't do politics. I feel that uh everybody's inundated with politics, whether it be on the TV, the phone, the laptop, and when they go out to watch comedy, just they want a break, man. And what I'm doing is I'm giving them a a break. I'm laughing. I'm being self-deprecating. I'm talking about my family. I've always said whatever the president is doing is not as funny as what my father's doing. So I kind of stick to kind of family uh and observational humor and and politics is something that I feel like if you start talking about in a way kind of splits the audience and it's just really not my interest. I'm not really interested so much in what's going on with politics. So my passion lies with my family and and and and that's what I talk about. Totally. Sebastian, I got to ask you. Did you see the viral clip? I think he reposted it actually from Saturday Night Live Marcelo Hernandez doing the Sebastian Maniscalo. This guy, he taught me everything I know. That's right. You know, ever since we were two kids at summer camp, back when we would be playing tennis, a shooting basketball, we used to love to swim. We were swimming. First of all, how did he do? But also, how did you react when you first saw it go on Saturday Night Live? Well, he asked me on Thursday to be a part of it. So, I couldn't because I was doing a show. So, when I first saw it, I was I was blown away. I really like Marcelo. He's a great great comedian. And uh I it was very flattering to see that on Saturday Night Live. You know, I got so many calls like, \"You made it. You were on Saturday Night Live.\" And I'm like, \"I've been doing this for 27 years, but it took Saturday Night Live to uh do a spoof on me for people to uh to say that I made it.\" So, I thought it was really really great and uh the exaggerated movements and whatnot. It was it was funny. I I really enjoyed it. How do you think he did? I feel like he clocked great, man. I mean, I think he did better than I did. I mean, this guy was uh doing jumps and splits and stuff that I wish I could do. Uh but uh yeah, man. I I I really enjoyed it. Hopefully, I'll get a I never even hosted the show. So, you never even hosted it. So, I'm making a plea here. Please, Lauren, have me on the show. Uh, and I would love to do a skit with Marcelo. Sebastian Manaskcalo, thank you so much for joining us, man. Appreciate you. Thank you. It ain't right is streaming on Hulu starting this Friday, November 21st.",
