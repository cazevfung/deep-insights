  "transcript": "Finally tonight here, one week until Thanksgiving. The remarkable effort now spreading across the country to put special medically tailored meals on the table. Here's Deborah Roberts. Tonight, with Thanksgiving just a week away, the extraordinary effort from so many all across the US to feed those in need. Welcome to the Gods Love Kitchen. This is a huge kitchen. It is huge. And it smells great, too, by the way. Amazing. In New York City, the nonprofit God's Love We Deliver for 40 years now since 1985, cooking and delivering special medically tailored meals and so much more. Terrence Mech, once a volunteer, is president and CEO. They're not alone at the end of the day, and that they have the dignity that they deserve, the love, compassion that we do here at God's Deliver. It's life-changing. You bring the connection. We do right to their door. An incredible 20,000 volunteers making 4 million meals a year. You're good at that. Very well done. Aurora decorating the cakes. Volunteering here for 6 years now. I just like the the feeling that I'm doing something for somebody that I don't actually know, but I feel that I know them. This Thanksgiving, more than a,000 volunteers cooking and delivering 12,500 dinners. That's 8,300 lb of turkey. Andy slicing. This is our bee and spinach stew. Lead sue chef Brian making soups. The veggies. Topping it all off with gravy. Robert adding the stuffing. Feline peeling potatoes. You're not just delivering food. You're bringing so much more to these folks. Yes. What I gave to God is so I got so much more. And they're not alone. Their model now expanding through the food is medicine coalition. The nonprofits Mama's Kitchen in San Diego, OpenHand Atlanta in Georgia, and Project Angel Heart in Denver. All delivering meals this Thanksgiving. Carry up those meals, give them that hug, say happy Thanksgiving. And it's the best. It's just the best. You're changing lives on both sides. We are. We are. It's changed my life. And I'm so grateful. No question. To help, go to God's Love We Deliver website, gl.org.",
