Ensure Data Integrity

Security and Traceability with LabX

For laboratories that must comply with GLP, GMP and GAMP regulations,

it is important to have documented evidence of activities that can be

checked by a second person and available for inspection. Compliance

with these regulations can help avoid import bans, product recalls, and

even the closing of production plants.

```
An impending audit is a source
of worry for many lab teams.
Knowing that you will – at any
time – be able to recreate the
sequence of events and circum-
stances which led to a certain
result or record can be very
reassuring.
```
Avoid FDA Warning Letters

```
Every year FDA warning letters
are issued due to a lack of data
integrity. The main reason for
issuance is incomplete data.
LabX prevents such situations
from occurring as all metadata
is securely stored along with
the actual results.
```
Data Integrity

Maximum Security Be Prepared for Audits

```
Full traceability, electronic sig-
natures, enforced SOP methods,
and extensive audit trails support
laboratories around the globe
with data integrity and regula-
tory compliance. LabX fully sup-
ports requirements for ALCOA+,
21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 
and ISO 17025.
```

```
Metadata
```
```
Balance ID
User ID
Tare Vessel
Calibration History
SOP
Method Version and More
```
Storing the result is not enough. Each result set has to be complete

and contain all relevant metadata. LabX helps achieve data integrity

in the laboratory following the ALCOA+ principle.

```
Example from HPLC analysis: LabX transfers the weighing records
to the Chromatography Data System (CDS) for subsequent HPLC
analyses. All weights and the full metadata are captured!

Versatile Performance Weighing

Smaller Samples, Higher Capacities

With METTLER TOLEDO’s high performance balances you can now weigh your

smallest sample quantities at higher capacities. This is particularly useful for

applications with substantial differences between the initial and final weight values,

or when the tare load is high compared to the weight of the applied material.

Heavy Tare, Light Product

```
Benefit from an increased weigh-
ing range and lower minimum
detectable sample load in appli-
cations where tare and sample
weights differ substantially. Com-
mon applications are:
```
- Gas filling
- Non-volatile residue
    determination
- Weight loss

Automated Powder Weighing

For the Highest Accuracy and Safety

XPR automatic balances dispense free-flowing powders with a level of accuracy

that even the most skillful hands cannot replicate in manual processes. Simply

enter a target weight and the exact amount required will be dispensed directly

into the target container to eliminate out-of-specification errors and significantly

lower exposure risk.

Automated Powder Weighing

Excellence

Unmatched Accuracy User Safety Assured Simplified Powder Dispensing

```
The XPR automatic balance can
dispense from 1 milli gram to
5 grams of free-flowing powder
directly into your target container.
This highly accurate process
eliminates vari ability and out-of-
specification results. Automated
dispensing can reduce the mini-
mum net sample weight by up
to 30 percent.
```
```
Potent or toxic compounds remain
sealed within the dosing head
and hence aerosol formation is
kept to a minimum. This ensures
that users are not exposed to
substances during weighing.
```
```
Nanoparticles, fine powders,
granules and heterogeneous
mixes are all suitable for dis-
pensing. Even hard to handle
or electrostatically charged
powders are accurately dosed
to target.
```

Automated Liquid Weighing

Precise Concentrations Every Time

In combination with a liquid dispensing module, the XPR automatic balance

enables you to prepare highly precise concentrations down to 0.1 milligram/gram.

Achieving a dilution factor of 10,000 is possible in one single step. The amounts

of solvent, standard and sample required are reduced considerably, saving costs

and waste.

Automated Liquid Weighing

Excellence

Highly Accurate Concentrations

```
Prepare concentrations down
to 0.1 milligram /gram in one
step in accordance with USP.
Automated liquid dosing delivers
precise concentrations every
time because solvent is added
automatically based on the actual
weight of weighed-in solids.
```
Manual Variability Eliminated

```
This gravimetric sample prepara-
tion uses precise balance results
to produce accurate concentra-
tions, in contrast to error-prone
visual readings when using volu-
metric flasks. Automatic results
recording also eliminates tran-
scription errors.
```
Compliance Supported

```
Due to the accuracy improve-
ments offered by gravimetric
procedures and liquid dosing,
the USP has approved these
methods and accepts them as
a viable alternative for solution
preparation.

Installation and Qualification

Ensure Productivity and Compliance

You may be tempted to simply connect your weighing instrument to the power

supply, switch it on and start weighing. However, your balance or moisture

analyzer is a sophisticated piece of weighing equipment. Correct installation

and configuration ensures your instrument performs as intended so that you

avoid weighing errors, rework, and waste as well as associated financial losses.

```
METTLER TOLEDO’s professional installation and qualification services help you to ensure your
instrument is in an optimum location, delivers accurate weight results and complies with
your internal and external regulations right from the start.
```
You benefit from:

- Immediate deployment
- Correct setup
- Professional qualification
- Initial user training
- Audit-proof documentation

Optimum Location Audit-Proof Documentation Error-Free Operation

```
Has staff been trained on the
new instrument?
```
```
Initial user training is included
so that operators are familiar
with how to use the new instru-
ment correctly. You get up and
running faster and operational
errors are minimized.
```
```
Is your instrument installed in
the optimum location?
```
```
External influences such as
drafts, direct sunlight, or an
unstable table can lead to drift
and random errors. The con-
sequences are inaccurate and
inconsistent weighing results.
```
```
Has your instrument been
professionally installed and
qualified?
```
```
In addition to in-depth opera-
tional testing and initial calibra-
tion, we provide audit-proof
documentation that complies
with regulations such as GMP,
GLP, and ISO.
```
Service: Installation and Qualification


Service: Installation and Qualification

Choose the Installation Pac that fulfills your quality and regulatory requirements

METTLER TOLEDO offers three different installation and qualification packages called EQPac, IPac and StarterPac. Each of them

includes installation, initial user training and a different level of qualification, the complexity of which is proportional to the degree

of industry regulation.

[http://www.mt.com/LabBalances-Service](http://www.mt.com/LabBalances-Service)
EQPac is used in highly regulated industries where
audits are carried out and all steps of the lifecycle
need to be documented with a high level of detail.
IPac is suitable when installation activities need to
be documented for quality standards.
StarterPac is a proof of installation with release
suitable for routine operation in environments with
varied levels of regulatory requirements.


Calibration and Routine Testing

Ensure Accurate Weighing Over Time

Having carefully selected your balance to ensure it meets your process

requirements, how can you be sure that your results remain accurate

over time? Do you know which routine tests and calibrations are necessary

to mitigate risks and pass any audit?

```
The Accuracy Calibration Certificate (ACC) assesses balance performance by documenting
measurement uncertainty in use. Various annexes are available as an interpretation of the
calibration results, each giving a clear pass / fail statement for certain tolerances applied.
```
```
The GWP® Certificate annex sets a new benchmark in weighing accuracy by linking the
performance of your balance to your specific process requirements. This annex documents that
your instrument is fit-for-purpose and can produce the accuracy required for your process.
```
```
To ensure ongoing accuracy and compliance, GWP® Verification provides you with a risk-based,
audit-proof routine testing and calibration plan.
```
GWP® Certificate

Is the instrument fit-for-purpose?

```
With the GWP® Certificate we
can help you determine whether
the balance meets your require-
ments. This documents that the
balance is fit for purpose and
used within the safe weighing
range.
```
Accuracy Calibration Certificate

```
How does your balance perform
on-site?
```
```
With the Accuracy Calibration
Certificate (ACC) we measure
the performance ( measurement
uncertainty) of the instrument
over the entire weighing range.
```
GWP® Verification

```
How can you maintain accuracy
over time?
```
```
Based on a risk assessment,
GWP® Verification helps you
establish a routine testing plan to
maintain consistent quality and
reduce costs. It also provides
you with regulatory compliance
documentation to pass audits.

Density Determination

Gravimetric Methods Ensure Accuracy

Quickly convert your analytical or precision balance for accurate density

determination of solid, liquid and viscous substances. Whether you use the

buoyancy technique, the displacement principle or the pycnometer method,

density determination is easy and efficient.

```
By simply removing the balance
weighing pan, the density kit can
be installed on your balance in
a few simple steps.
```
```
The built-in density application
on our balances provides user
guidance, collects results, calcu-
lates density values and allows
statistical evaluation of a mea-
surement series. Five methods
are included.

AntiStatic Solutions
Eliminate Electrostatic Effects
When your weight values are unstable or different for the same sample, the explanation
is often simple: Electrostatic charges on the sample or container influence the weighing
cell and lead to inaccurate results. AntiStatic kits immediately neutralize electrostatic
charges to ensure stable and accurate results.
The optional ionizing module for
XPR analytical balances can be
set to work automatically if elec-
trostatic charges are detected in
the weighing chamber. Charges
are removed in just a few sec-
onds, ensuring stable and accu-
rate results.
AntiStatic kits completely
remove electrostatic charges.
The scattering of powdery sub-
stances is eliminated, making
dosing safer and preventing
cross-contamination.
By neutralizing electrostatic
charges on samples and contain-
ers when the balance is loaded,
dosing is faster and productivity
is increased.

Powder Dosing Heads

Dosing and Storage in One

The dosing head has been developed to dose free-flowing powdery substances

such as APIs or reference standards in conjunction with an XPR dosing system.

Our dosing heads are suitable for dosing fine, fluffy, static, compacted,

granular, or heterogeneous substances. The use of a closed system avoids

cross-contamination and protects the user, the substance and the environment.

```
A highly precise mechanism
ensures homogeneous powder
flow. The dosing head learns
powder behavior and optimizes
dosing accuracy and speed.
While no configuration is needed,
any target weight can be hit.
```
```
Powders are sealed within the
dosing head. Individual dosing
heads for each powder eliminate
the risk of cross-contamination.
Once the dosing head is filled,
work proceeds with no powder
contact.
```
```
A storage container protects your
dosing heads when not in use
and ensures that valuable and
toxic substances remain safe.
The container is impact-resistant
and watertight for safe storage.

head for your powder type,

many standards, such as GMP and ISO 9001. Your internal quality assurance

department may also specify what testing is necessary. In addition, audits of

weighing equipment typically require documented proof of balance testing and

calibration that can be traced to official reference standards.

METTLER TOLEDO‘s stainless steel test weights with a calibration certificate satisfy the highest

requirements for periodic balance performance checks. Each test weight is delivered with

a  calibration certificate from a METTLER TOLEDO calibration laboratory that has been produced

in accordance with ISO / IEC 17025 requirements to fulfill metrological traceability requirements.

CarePac Weight Sets

Your Routine Testing Solution

Weights: Test Weights

A CarePac® contains everything you need to limit the risk of working outside

specified process tolerances. Two test weights are carefully selected to

correspond to 5 percent and 100 percent of your balance’s capacity – precisely

what USP Chapter 41 recommends for balance testing.

```
Tailored to your specific requirements, the three sizes of
CarePac weight sets enable you to test balances of up
to 8 kilograms weighing capacity. CarePac weights are
specified to validate process tolerances up to 0.03 percent.
```
```
All CarePac sets are delivered with a calibration certificate
and include tweezers, gloves and other accessories for
professional weight handling.
```
```
With just two carefully selected
weights, a CarePac has every-
thing you need for efficient routine
balance testing in accordance
with USP Chapter 41 and GWP®.
```
```
All CarePac sets have the option
to add a third weight to accom-
modate individual testing require-
ments. The nominal value of the
third weight is between 1 miligram
and 100 grams.
```
Effortless Weight Selection Optional Third Weight

```
Supplied as standard with each
CarePac are ergonomic accesso-
ries such as tweezers or weight
forks and a cleaning cloth. This
allows professional weight han-
dling and testing right from the
first day without wasting time
searching for the right tools.

```
All weights are made of premium
stainless steel to make them
corrosion resistant. Monobloc
weights are designed for long-
term stability, and weights with
an adjusting cavity simplify
weight adjustment without the
need for specialized equipment.
```
```
Our unique manufacturing pro-
cess involves traditional me-
chanical polishing, final stage
electrolytic polishing, fully auto-
mated cleaning and final calibra-
tion using state-of-the-art mass
comparators.
```
Design and Construction Expertly Crafted

```
To protect the integrity of the
weight and ensure a long life-
time, all weights are supplied in
a robust, easy-to-clean plastic
container. Approved materials,
including foam inserts, make
them a durable solution.
```
Protection and Longevity

High quality stainless steel test weights provide the best way to verify balance

and scale performance and prevent out-of-specification errors. Premium stainless

steel weights are corrosion resistant and provide long-term stability over their

entire life span.

```
Using test weights without a calibration certificate may be acceptable in certain cases. However, test
weights with a calibration certificate provide a more comprehensive option in case documentation
should ever be requested. Certification relates to verifying and documenting accuracy. Even if not
required by regulations, using test weights with a calibration certificate provides the reassurance that all
your weight measurements can be validated at any time. For example, working according to ISO 9001
requires documented metrological traceability, so test weights with a certificate are necessary.

Reference Weights

The Highest in Metrological Performance

Weights: Test Weights

National metrology institutes (NMIs) strive for measurements with the smallest

uncertainty. “E0” calibration weights, which have a higher accuracy than E1,

enable the highest metrological performance when calibration mass standards.

```
To produce “E0” weights, METTLER TOLEDO hand selects the best E1 weights which are then
calibrated by an NMI with an uncertainty of 1/ 5*MPE (E1). These reference weights are delivered
with the NMI calibration certificate.

High-Throughput Pipetting


The LTS LiteTouch System

Because Pipetting Shouldn’t Hurt

Minimize fatigue and risk of developing repetitive strain injury (RSI)

with the Rainin LTS™ LiteTouch™ tip ejection system.

Ergonomic LTS LiteTouch System

```
The Rainin
LiteTouch System
is available on all
Rainin XLS+ single
and multichannel
pipettes.
```
The LTS difference

Universal pipetting

```
The Rainin LiteTouch System dramatically reduces
the amount of force required to load and eject tips.
LTS pipettes work in concert with LTS tips to deliver
a perfect seal every time.
```
- LTS tips slide easily over the shaft to create a firm,
    airtight fit with minimal force.
- A thin sealing ring near the top of an LTS tip virtually
    eliminates friction between the tip and shaft.

```
Universal pipettes have cone-shaped shafts that rely
on friction to hold tips firmly.
```
- Universal tips stretch to fit around the shaft.
- Users typically apply force to the shaft to achieve
    a reliable friction seal.
- Due to the excessive force used to insert the tip,
    a high force is required to eject the tip.

```
Large sealing area
creates high friction
```
```
Conical shaft
stretches the tip
```
```
Small sealing ring
significantly reduces friction
```
```
Positive stop
prevents jamming

TerraRack

The Most Eco-Friendly Rack Around

TerraRack™ is a revolutionary concept in tip racks. These completely recyclable

stands are as sturdy as conventional racks, yet they are made with less than

half the plastic. In fact, the hinged TerraRack shell is made from PETE, which is

easily recycled.

```
For convenience and complete cleanliness, TerraRacks with BioClean Ultra tips come sterilized,
eliminating the need to autoclave.
```

```
Pipette Tips and Racks

Less Waste 100 Percent Recyclable Sterile

```
With 50 percent less plastic than
conventional racks, TerraRacks
are also extremely compressible
so used racks occupy significantly
less space in a recycling or stor-
age container.
```
```
In addition to being completely
recyclable, much of each
TerraRack is composed of PETE,
which is easily recycled and
aggressively recovered from
the plastic waste stream.
```
```
TerraRacks are sterilized. Unlike
refill systems where there is a
potential for placing clean tips into
a contaminated rack, you can be
certain that you’re working with
a fresh, clean rack every time.

controlled by the titrator
and full security is ensured
by the overflow protector
in the waste bottle. User
safety is increased by limit-
ing exposure to  dangerous

The innovative one-piece cap
enables simple and fast sample
preparation with less chance of
chemical exposure. Just weigh
your sample directly and fasten
the screw cap to protect your
sample from moisture and air
contamination.
```
Secure Gas Flow Control

```
The electronic gas flow meter
al lows you to control the gas flow
entering the titration cell. Once
the flow rate is set, it cannot be
changed and can be checked at
a glance. This modular system
adapts to the operator’s work-
flows: The gas flow can either be
generated with the air pump or
controlled through the lab’s own
gas line.
```
Save Precious Time

```
The Temperature Scan feature
speeds up analyses by determin-
ing the optimum heating temper-
ature for your sample. Record the
substance’s heating curve and
determine the optimal temper-
ature in just a single run. When
the ideal heating temperature of
a substance is uncertain, Temper-
ature Scan provides the answer.

Digital Instruments
Digital density meters and refractometers have mostly replaced manual
methods like hydrometers, pycnometers or Abbe refractometers, which are
often prone to operator handling errors. Get repeatable results at a push
of a button, measuring density, specific gravity, refractive index, Brix
and more. For increased efficiency and data integrity, the data can be
transferred to a PC software.
```
```
Built-In Temperature Control
For highly accurate results, our benchtop models have a built-in Peltier
temperature control and a very precise temperature sensor, ensuring that
the measurement is performed at the exact target temperature.
```
```
Simplified Quality Control
Get immediate color-coded pass / fail information at the end of the
measurement. Target values, limits and methods can be defined for
each product. Measurement results are then displayed in red if they
are outside the limits.

The rotatable electrode clip can
be attached on the left, right or
both sides of all instruments.
It allows measurements to be
taken with just one hand and is
a convenient, space­saving way
of storing electrodes.
```
```
SevenGo Duo fits neatly into your
hand whether you are right­ or
left ­handed. The size of the but-
tons reflects their importance.
SevenGo Duo is so easy to use
that you can really save time and
increase your productivity.
```
```
The large SevenGo Duo display
shows all relevant settings and
highlights the most important
items. You can read the mea-
surement value and check the
state of the electrode at a glance.
The results of parallel measure-
ments appear in an alternating
fashion on the display.

METTLER TOLEDO offers certified
buffers, standards and elec-
trolytes for the calibration of your
pH sensors.
To minimize the effect of drift and to
maintain accurate measurements
over time, calibrate your pH sensor
before every set of measurements.
For pH, the use of at least 2 buf-
fers is recommended to establish
a calibration curve and ensure
that further measurements are ac-
curate. Calibrating your pH sensor
with our certified solutions extends
the sensor’s lifetime and saves on
future replacement costs.

make better decisions to develop processes with higher

quality in less time and at lower costs.

Automated Sampling

Real-Time Analysis

```
Process Automation Overview

```
Early-Phase Development
Synthesis workstations, real-time analytical technology, and in situ
sampling allow chemists to quickly develop new synthetic routes,
then safely deliver grams to kilograms of materials. These tools provide
initial understanding of process scale-up issues, enabling scientists
to eliminate non-viable candidates early in development. A common
software platform for all instruments makes it simple to visualize,
interpret and report results.
```
```
Process Development
The combination of reaction calorimeters, Fourier-Transform Infrared
(FTIR)-based in situ reaction analysis systems, and inline particle
size and shape analysis tools supports process understanding from a
chemistry, thermodynamics, and particle-characterization perspective.
Integrated software provides a deeper understanding with less effort.
Whether a batch or continuous process, enhanced quality and quantity
of knowledge enables engineers to quickly scale up, eliminate failures
and avoid safety incidents.
```
```
Scale Up and Manufacturing
Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools ensure processes are
within boundary conditions, eliminating the risk of batch failures
while  delivering higher yields at lower cost. PAT systems allow users
to realize the benefits of Quality by Design (QbD) through the transfer
of more robust, lower-cost commercial processes to manufacturing.

Automated Sampling

Unattended, Representative Samples

Sampling chemical reactions for offline analysis to determine reaction progression

or impurity profiles is standard practice. However, the manual process is

challenging when sampling air-sensitive reactions, reactions at elevated pressure,

or heterogeneous mixtures. Poor sampling reproducibility and delays in quenching

can lead to variable results and analytical inaccuracies. EasySampler™ was

designed to eliminate these challenges by providing an automated and robust

inline method of taking representative samples from reactions.

```
It is labor intensive or impos-
sible to sample reactions that
are air- or moisture-sensitive,
at  elevated pressure or sub-
ambient temperature, or highly
toxic. EasySampler’s unique
probe enables sample capture
and immediate quench so
samples are representative
of the reaction at the time of
sampling.
```
```
Sampling reactions with preci sion
is challenging, especially for het-
erogeneous or multiphase reac-
tions. EasySampler samples from
the same position in the reactor
into a fixed-volume pocket. Solids
begin dissolving immediately in
the quench step for accurate and
reproducible analytical data.
```
```
Sampling long reactions or
a series of DOE experiments
can be impractical. The lack
of samples leads to blind spots
in data, thus requiring repeat
experiments. EasySampler can
be programmed with a sequence
for continued sampling opera-
tions 24 hours a day to increase
productivity and decrease project
timelines and cost.
```

Automated Sampling

Difficult Reactions to Sample Representative and Reproducible Automated and Unattended


Automated Sampling

After quenching, the liquid

handling system dilutes the

sample to a user specified

concentration and transfers it to

a vial, ready for offline analysis.

Quench and dilution steps can

function as sample derivatization

steps, thus decreasing sample

preparation time and eliminating

human error.

(DSC) utilizes an innovative sen-

sor with a patented star-shaped

arrangement of 120 thermocou-

ples that provides unmatched

sensitivity and resolution.

```

Crucibles and Sensors for Thermal Analysis

```
Crucibles serve as containers for samples during thermoanalytical measurements. The type of crucible used can have a large effect
on results quality and influence important DSC measuring-cell characteristics. In Flash DSC, the sample is placed directly onto the
MultiSTAR™ chip sensor. The patented dynamic power compensation control circuit allows measurements to be performed with a
minimum noise level at high heating and cooling rates.

Hot-stage microscopy is a powerful tool that is widely used for the visual

characterization of all kinds of thermal transitions. The possibility of directly

observing morphological changes in a sample as it is heated or cooled is of

enormous value. Changes in the shape, structure and color of crystals are seen

as well as their size and number. The technique allows phase transitions to be

characterized and provides information on expansion and shrinkage behavior.

Hot-Stage Microscopy

Seeing is Believing

Features and Benefits

- Imaging possibilities – allows polymorphic
    transitions to be studied visually
- Closed-furnace design – ensures excellent
    temperature control
- High sensitivity – optical sensitivity is not
    influenced by heating or cooling rates
- STARe free evaluation – an opportunity to
    use free evaluation software

Improve Sustainability in the Lab

Your Green Journey Put into Practice

```
With the growing effects of climate change, sustainability is increasingly urgent
across industries. In the lab, however, productivity often means elevated consumption
of materials, including reagents and single-use plastics.
```
```
METTLER TOLEDO’s Sustainability Guide takes a critical look at climate impact.
It outlines our own efforts to reduce our climate footprint, both in-house and throughout
our supply chain, and suggests strategies laboratories can take to limit their
environmental impact as well.
```
Learn more about:

- Instrument lifetime – fewer replacements mean you will need less materials
- Miniaturized measurements – smaller samples reduce your solution use and disposal
- Electronic data capture – reduce your reliance on paper while remaining compliant

Practical examples and further reading will help you on your way.
