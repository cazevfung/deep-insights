## systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging, pharmaceutical, packaged consumer goods, and other industries). We are a

## leading global provider of metal detectors, x-ray systems, checkweighers, and camera-based imaging equipment that are used in these

## industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be

## generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray inspection is used to detect metallic contamination in applications unsuited to metal

## detectors and many types of non-metallic contamination, such as glass, calcified bone, stones, and pits. Our x-ray systems are also used

## for mass control and for determining and controlling the fat content in meat. Checkweighers are used to control the filled weight of

## packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Our camera-based vision inspection solutions provide in-line inspection of

## package quality, labels, and content, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical companies.

## All of our technologies are integrated with material handling systems to ensure the correct presentation of the customer’s product to

## the device and the secure rejection of non-conforming product, and are frequently designed to comply with stringent hygiene standards.

## Our technologies may also be used together as components of integrated packaging lines. ProdX Inspect is our quality and productivity

## control software for helping customers comply with regulations and optimize process efficiency, either as a stand-alone solution or

## through integration with the customer’s manufacturing and enterprise systems.

## Retail Weighing Solutions

## Supermarkets, hypermarkets, and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for

## handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits, or cheeses). We offer weighing and software solutions, which can integrate

## counter, self-service, backroom, and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item

## and inventory management system. In addition, we offer weighing solutions for fast-growing areas like self-checkout and unmanned

## stores, as well as AI-driven image recognition solutions for fresh goods. The customer benefits of our retail solutions are in the areas of

## enterprise-wide device management as well as article and price management, merchandising, and regulatory compliance. In North

## America and select other markets, our offering also includes automated packaging and labeling solutions for the meat backroom, which

## are fully integrated with the scales in the store. The retail business accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales in 2024, 6% in 2023,

## and 5% in 2022.

## Customers and Distribution

## Our principal customers include companies in the following key end-markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and biotech

## companies, as well as independent research organizations and testing labs); food manufacturers; chemical, specialty chemicals, and

## cosmetics companies; the academic community; food retailers; the transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; and the

## electronics industry.

## Our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are sold through

## our direct sales force, while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through direct channels exceed our

## sales through indirect channels. A significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated through indirect channels, including sales

## of our Ohaus-branded products. Ohaus-branded products target markets, such as the educational market, in which customers are

## interested in lower cost, a more limited set of features, and less comprehensive support and service.

## We have a diversified customer base, with no single end-customer accounting for more than 1% of 2024 net sales.

## Sales and Service

## Market Organizations

## We maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and

## service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships with

## customers in our target market segments. Each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while

## maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions. Market

## organizations also work closely with our producing organizations (described below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product

## development initiatives, new product and application ideas, and information about key market segments.

## We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we

## compete against. At December 31, 2024, our sales and service group consisted of approximately 9,000 employees in sales, marketing and

## customer service (including related administration), and post-sales technical service, located in approximately 40 countries. This field

## organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is

## important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach.

## Service

## Our service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services, as well as further

## expanding our offerings to provide value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance, performance

## enhancements, application expertise and training, and remote services. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in

## promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with FDA and other international regulations, and we can provide these services to

## most customers’ locations around the world. Our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging

## markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service contracts,

## on-demand services, and replacement parts) accounted for approximately 24% of our net sales in 2024, 23% in 2023, and 20% in 2022.

### 8


## Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention.

## The close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers, which

## provides us with high-quality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas.

## Research and Development and Manufacturing

## Producing Organizations

## Our research, product development, and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused

## producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs, improve customer focus, and maintain technological

## leadership. The producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and coordinated

## customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations. We also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy

## customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistics processes.

## Research and Development

## We continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new

## applications. Over the last three years, we have invested $551 million in research and development ($189 million in 2024, $185 million in

## 2023, and $177 million in 2022), which is approximately 5% of net sales for each year. Our research and development efforts fall into

## three categories:

## • technology advancements, which generate new products or features and increase the value of our products. These advancements

## may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for our technologies, more accurate or reliable

## measurement, additional software capability, or automation through robotics or other means.

## • applications development to complement our products and provide complete solutions to our customers.

## • cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design and/or improve the ease of

## serviceability.

## We devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development. This includes software to

## process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments, application-specific software, and software that connects our solutions into

## customers’ existing IT systems. We closely integrate research and development with marketing, manufacturing, and product engineering.

## We have approximately 1,600 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe.

## Manufacturing

## We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United

## Kingdom, and Mexico. We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our products require very strict

## tolerances and exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing

## process. All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001 certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient

## to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.

## We generally manufacture critical components, which are components that contain proprietary technology. When outside

## manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other manufacturers for certain non-proprietary components. We use a wide range of

## suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of

### 9


## materials. From time to time, we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements

## for electronic components are generally made globally.

## Backlog; Seasonality

## Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products.

## Backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically not longer than one to two months.

## Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory instruments

## business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than, sales in the

## second and third quarters. Prior to 2023, fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 27% to 30% of our net sales. This

## trend has a somewhat greater effect on earnings before taxes than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all

## quarters. Quarterly seasonality in 2023 and 2024 was impacted by shipping delays at our European Logistics facility in the fourth quarter

## of 2023, which was recovered in the first quarter of 2024.

## Employees

## Our total global workforce was approximately 17,300, consisting of 16,000 employees and 1,300 temporary personnel, as of

## December 31, 2024, and includes approximately 6,200 in Europe, 4,800 in North and South America, and 6,300 in Asia and other

## countries.

## We are proud of our corporate culture and our talented employees. We endeavor to continue to provide an attractive work

## environment and keep our employees fully engaged. We know that our future success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining the

## best employees. We promote equal opportunity and inclusiveness worldwide and value diversity in our global workforce, which reflects

## the diversity in the many communities in which we operate internationally. We employ people of more than 100 nationalities.

## We promote diversity and we encourage all employees, inclusive of all our demographics, to take on more responsibilities and

## management positions. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 36% of our global employee headcount was female, with approximately

## 29% holding management positions. We place great emphasis on performance management, training, and developing our employees

## across all levels and regions. During 2024, approximately 93% of employees completed one or more training courses, including part-time

## and temporary personnel. Lastly, we have local safety programs in place in all relevant units, and select locations have implemented a

## certified work safety management system. Severe workplace accidents are rare and there has been one fatality from an occupational

## incident related to a motor vehicle accident in the past five years.

## We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last

## five years. Approximately 8,000 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent

## employee interests.

## Sustainability

## Sustainability touches all aspects of our business, from designing, sourcing, and producing our products, to selling and delivering

## them to our customers, to handling them at the end of their lifecycle. A sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for

## our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate our business. We want to manage our

## business sustainably to position the Company for long-term growth. More than 15 years ago, we launched our GreenMT program to

## pursue environmental, social, and governance priorities where we can have a significant positive impact. We do this in five key areas: (1)

## keeping our operations sustainable over the

### 10


## long term by ensuring we use resources efficiently, (2) helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering sustainable

## products and services, (3) promoting responsible practices within our supply chain, (4) ensuring an engaged workforce through fair,

## attractive, safe, and development-minded workplaces (see Employees section above), and (5) following corporate governance best

## practices.

## We have set a number of goals relating to our GreenMT sustainability program, including reducing our carbon footprint and other

## environmental, social, and governance goals. As an example, as of 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality with respect to Scope 1 and

## Scope 2 CO emissions by realizing efficiency improvements, sourcing 100% renewable electricity for all our operations, and using

## offsets. We also have goals relating to waste, including reducing our waste intensity by 20% and achieving zero waste to landfill, in each

## case by 2025. Furthermore, we are committed to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science

## deems necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Our commitment includes near-term and long-term

## net-zero targets approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). As a further example, we pursue several goals related to supply

## chain transparency including risk assessments and targeted supplier audits. We report annually on our progress related to sustainability

## topics in our Corporate Responsibility Report, available on http://www.mt.com/sustainability.

## Blue Ocean Program

## Blue Ocean refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized, automated, and integrated processes and

## high levels of global data transparency. It encompasses an enterprise architecture, with a global, single-instance ERP system. Within our

## IT systems, we continue to move toward integrated, homogeneous applications and common data structures. We also are largely

## standardizing our key business processes. The implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis

## over a multi-year period. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our operations in the U.S., China, most of Asia Pacific, and

## most of Europe. We estimate that we have more than 90% of our users on the program, and we will continue to implement additional

## locations and functionality over the coming years.

## Intellectual Property

## We hold over 5,400 patents and trademarks (including pending applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland, China, the

## European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and India. Our products generally incorporate

## a wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are protected by patents of various durations. Products are generally not

## protected as a whole by individual patents, and as a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We have

## numerous trademarks, including the Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our business. We regularly protect against

## infringement of our intellectual property.

## Regulation

## Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of our

## electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with

## applicable regulations.

## Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected

## by other instruments. In addition, some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which prices based on weight are

## calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are a large number of regulatory agencies

## across our markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized

## across the European Union.

## Our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory customers

## are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), pharmaceutical

## customers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries may be subject to

## Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to

## special requirements.

## Environmental Matters

## We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of

## properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur,

## capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.

## In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of

## these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that

## these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the

## subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to

## date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to

## additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,

## or cash flows.

## Competition

## Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by

## application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors,

## many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with

## potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets

## and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively

## small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these

## emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more

## significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain

## product lines and geographic markets.

## We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with

## competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we

## may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our

## global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global

## sales and service offering; our large installed base of instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region,

## product range, application, and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and

## marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have

## sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing, and maintaining any

## competitive advantages.

## We believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application

## support, service support, and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater

### 12


## demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory

## market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

## Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results

## Operational Risks

## We sell primarily to companies in developed countries. An economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating

## results.

## Most of our business is derived from companies in developed countries. Economic uncertainty in many parts of the world, including

## the impact of high inflationary environments and governmental monetary policies and related interest rates to combat inflation, the war in

## Ukraine, continuing conflicts in the Middle East, international trade disputes, tariffs, and sovereign debt levels in the European Union and

## the United States, are situations that we monitor closely. If developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession, we could

## see the following effects:

## • a drop in demand for our products;

## • companies being unable to finance their businesses;

## • difficulty in obtaining materials and supplies;

## • potential devaluation and/or impairment of assets;

## • difficulty in collecting accounts receivables;

## • an increase in accounts receivable write-offs; and

## • greater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow.

## Economic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital

## expenditures. Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after

## economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability.

## In addition, a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital

## markets and our business.

## We are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations, including our significant concentration of

## business in China and ongoing developments related to Russia, Ukraine, and the Middle East.

## We conduct business in many countries, including emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, and these

## operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings. In addition to the currency risks discussed below, our international

## operations pose other potential substantial risks and problems for us, including the following:

## • recently reduced market demand in our core segments in China and the current economic conditions in this region;

## • local tariffs and trade barriers and the potential for retaliatory tariffs;

## • additions or revisions to a country's legal and regulatory requirements;

## • difficulties in staffing and managing local operations and/or mandatory salary increases;

## • credit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors;

## • difficulties in protecting intellectual property;

## • nationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets, as we hold significant assets around the world

## in the form of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable, as well as $13.9 million of cash at

## December 31, 2024, in our Chinese subsidiaries;

## • restrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership;

### 14


## • adverse tax consequences, including tax disputes and imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and

## other payments by subsidiaries;

## • domestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition;

## • other uncertain local economic, political, and social conditions, including inflation, hyper-inflation, and other decreases in

## purchasing power, or periods of low or no productivity growth;

## • reduced foreign investment and/or demand;

## • credit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers;

## • geopolitical topics within Asia and other regions; and

## • emerging markets can be volatile and change quickly.

## China represents a significant portion of our business and financial results and has an important role in our global supply chain. For

## example, our Chinese operations accounted for 16% of sales to external customers, 29% of total segment profit, and approximately 30%

## of our global production during 2024. In recent years, geopolitical tensions have increased, particularly between the United States and

## China. Among other issues, these geopolitical topics have resulted in increased tariffs and trade restrictions. The Chinese government and

## other governments have also increased their focus on domestic purchasing requirements. In addition, due to increasing political tensions

## and potential tariff increases, many companies are seeking increased flexibility in their supply chains that may result in reduced foreign

## investment in China. The Chinese economy remains under pressure and is impacted by challenges with the country's real estate market

## that affects domestic consumption and has historically been a source of funds for government stimulus. These risks, all of which will be

## exacerbated by trade wars and tariffs, could lead to reduced sales in China, as well as higher costs.

## After benefiting from significant growth in 2022 and 2021, market demand in China declined significantly during the second half of

## 2023, which continued in 2024. Our business is significantly impacted by market demand in our core segments of

## pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical. Market conditions also can be volatile and change quickly, as experienced

## in 2023.

## We must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies. For example,

## we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in China into other currencies and to repatriate these funds. If we

## cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations or these regulations are amended to make it more difficult to repatriate the

## funds, we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in China.

## We are required to comply with various import, export control, and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with

## certain customers, business partners, and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and

## subsidiaries. We address below the topic of economic sanctions laws related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which commenced in

## February 2022. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products,

## services, and technologies, and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item.

## Failure to comply with any regulations and sanctions could result in civil and criminal actions, monetary and non-monetary penalties,

## disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.

## In response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., European Union, and other countries imposed economic sanctions on

## Russian entities, while Russia enacted countermeasures. We continue to monitor developments and applicable sanctions.

## Since February 2022, we have suspended all shipments to Russia. In 2021, Russia and Ukraine accounted for approximately 1% of

## our net sales, and as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, our assets

### 15


## and liabilities in both countries remained immaterial. We also do not have manufacturing in Russia or Ukraine.

## The EU Council has been working to expand renewable energy use, reduce consumption, and diversify energy sources due to

## reduced Russian energy supplies. This may impact energy availability and costs in Europe.

## We do not manufacture in the Middle East and sales in the region account for less than 1% of total revenue. Ongoing conflicts may

## impact demand locally and globally while disrupting supply chains, increasing costs, and reducing shipping capacity, all of which could

## affect our financial results and customer demand. Escalating global conflicts, including in Ukraine and the Middle East, have heightened

## economic and geopolitical uncertainty.

## Estimating the impact of ongoing global conflicts on supply chain disruptions and energy shortages is challenging. However, the

## Ukraine invasion and Middle East conflict could negatively affect our financial results and pose risks to our business. Additionally,

## uncertainties surrounding these conflicts persist, and their effects on the global economy and market conditions can change rapidly.

## We continue to monitor developments in these conflicts and any related sanctions.

## Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack.

## We rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders, support our

## customers, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our internally developed system and processes, as well as those provided by third-party

## vendors, may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents, such as terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of

## malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information, insider risk, or other security breaches. If there

## is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality. Many of our systems

## are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause.

## Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or

## unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers could result in our

## suffering significant financial and reputational damage.

## Customers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our

## products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a

## customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information, whether or not caused by us, we

## could face harm to our reputation and financial condition.

## The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber attacks and compromise information technology infrastructure, as well as

## the sources and targets of these attacks, change and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for

## some time. In addition, there has been an increase in state-sponsored cyber attacks which are often conducted by capable, well-funded

## groups. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplify these concerns.

## While we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures, including mandatory quarterly

## ongoing employee training and awareness, technical security controls, enhanced data protection, and maintenance of backup and

## protective systems, our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect

## on our business. We believe our mitigation measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Despite any

## precautions we may take, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and

### 16


## financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events. Our cyber liability insurance may

## not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of

## cybersecurity incidents.

## In addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection worldwide, such as the European

## General Data Protection Regulation which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our

## products or services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If we violate or fail to comply

## with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, and such fines or penalties could have a

## material adverse effect on our business and operations.

## We are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks, which could harm our business.

## We rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, support our customers, fulfill

## orders, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss,

## telecommunication failures, malicious employees or employee negligence, computer viruses, and other events. When we upgrade or

## change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. A significant number of our systems are not

## redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Any interaction with third-party systems increases

## cyber-attack risks. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, fraudulent or

## negligent loss of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which could harm our reputation and financial condition.

## Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or

## data loss as a result of system failures.

## Customers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage confidential information. Though we take steps to ensure

## our products and/or software are secure, it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products. If a customer

## alleges system failures in our products and/or software cause or contribute to a loss, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to

## our reputation and our financial condition and legal liability.

## We have also been implementing our Blue Ocean program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems

## that includes the implementation of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. This has been proceeding on a staggered basis

## over a multi-year period. We have implemented the program in our operations in the U.S., China, most of Asia Pacific, and most of

## Europe. We estimate that we have more than 90% of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and

## functionality over the coming years. If our implementation is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer-facing

## activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data, experience reduced functionality, or have delays

## in reporting financial information. In addition, the program has increased our reliance on a single information technology system, which

## would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption.

## Our ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted.

## We have key manufacturing facilities located in China, Europe, and the United States. Many of our products are developed and

## manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. In addition, a large portion of our products and spare parts are

## distributed through regional logistics centers, in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties. If we experience any

## significant disruption in these facilities for any reason, such as global supply chain and production issues, changes in third-party service

## providers, pandemics, strikes or other labor unrest, labor shortages, power interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, fire, earthquakes,

## hurricanes, floods, rising water levels, other weather events or natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change), or

## other events beyond our control,

### 17


## we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales. It may be expensive to resolve these

## issues, even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and

## may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.

## Our business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material.

## We purchase most of our raw materials, components, and supplies from multiple suppliers. Some items are purchased from a limited

## or single source of supply, and disruption of these sources whether as a result of issues with our suppliers' operation or the timely

## availability of shipments from freight carriers could affect our ability to manufacture products. Even where multiple sources of materials

## and components are available, the quality of the alternative materials, regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use

## in manufacturing, and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and

## possible loss of sales. If we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time, this could damage our customer

## relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations.

## Our product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner.

## To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing,

## customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain to ensure that our products do not become

## technologically obsolete over time. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In

## developing new products, we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability.

## In addition, as we develop new products and services, we could be required to comply with additional regulations. If we fail to

## comply with the new regulations, it could affect the launch of the new product and service, in particular, and our company, as a whole.

## For instance, it is expected that laws and regulations around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools will increase

## over the next few years, but it is unknown at this time what these laws and regulations will address and how and whether they will be

## adopted globally. As we introduce AI and machine learning into our technology platform (as well as those of our customers through

## provision of our services), we could become subject to these new regulations, which may be difficult to comply with. Some of our

## competitors may not be required to comply, which would put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, challenges with properly

## managing the use of AI could result in reputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of

## operations. Further, if we fail to adopt these new technologies, we may face price pressure from competitors using lower-cost AI systems.

## As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and

## development activities.

## We face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our

## business.

## We sell some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks,

## including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks, and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key

## distributors for a product or market, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings. Distributors may also

## face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables. Violations of the FCPA or

## similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially impact our business. In addition to financial

## risk, the actions of some of our distributors could cause

### 18


## reputational harm, especially if our products are involved. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses,

## and weaken our competitive position.

## Departures of key employees could impair our operations.

## Key employees could leave the Company. If any key employees stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. Important

## R&D personnel may leave and join competitors, which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects. We have no

## key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives.

## A pandemic or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue could negatively affect our business, making it more

## difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers, and could result in reduced demand from our customers.

## Our operations are vulnerable to global events, including pandemics like COVID-19. Despite precautions, such outbreaks can lead

## to business shutdowns, illness, quarantines, and workforce disruptions. Events in key regions such as North America, Europe, or China

## could significantly impact commercial activity, adversely affecting our financial condition, operations, and prospects.

## If operations are curtailed, we may need alternative suppliers or staff, which could be more expensive, unavailable, or cause

## shipment delays, impacting results. A disruption in product design could delay new product introductions, while affected customers may

## reduce or delay purchases, further impacting our operations.

## Our business involves certain operating risks, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses or

## liabilities we might incur in our operations.

## We have procured various insurance policies for certain types of insurance coverage and in varying coverage amounts. Our

## insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations. As a result of market conditions,

## premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could

## become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. We also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain

## or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were

## uninsured or for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations,

## and cash flows.

## Strategic Risks

## A prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical

## industries could adversely affect our operating results. A reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our

## customers could reduce our sales.

## Our products are used extensively in the pharma/biopharmaceutical, food manufacturing, and chemical industries. We recently

## experienced reduced demand in these segments, which negatively impacted our net sales in 2023 and 2024. Market demand in

## pharma/biopharmaceutical was particularly impacted in 2023 after significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consolidation in

## these industries also hurt our sales in the past. A prolonged global economic downturn, a downturn affecting one or more of these

## industries, or consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the capital spending

## policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control, including the resources

## available for purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, and policies regarding capital

## expenditures. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could

### 19


## harm our profitability. Changes in governmental regulations or a decline in government funding of research or education could reduce

## some customers’ ability to purchase our products.

## We operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins, gain market share,

## and maintain a technological advantage.

## Our markets are highly competitive. Many are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and

## food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their

## markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than

## our own. There has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years. Any consolidation

## within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own. Some of

## our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new

## competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets.

## Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets,

## emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our

## markets could harm our operating margins.

## We also expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products

## with competitive prices. If tariffs are implemented and we cannot pass on the increased costs to our customers, our margins could be

## impacted as we work to remain competitive. In addition, our competitors are expected to continue to improve their technology

## infrastructure, as well as the technology services offered to their customers, including the use of artificial intelligence and machine

## learning solutions, to interact with suppliers, sell their products and services, and support and grow their customer base. Our ability to

## innovate our own technology infrastructure and appropriately address user experience could affect our ability to compete. Although we

## believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these

## advantages.

## We may face risks associated with future acquisitions.

## We may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies, or businesses, but these involve risks such as integration

## challenges, management distractions, and potential loss of key employees. Future acquisitions may also lead to stock issuances that dilute

## current shareholders, increased debt and liabilities, and higher amortization expenses for intangible assets. Any of these risks could

## materially impact our profitability.

## Larger companies are increasingly targeting life sciences and instruments, potentially altering market competition. Additionally, we

## may face challenges in identifying, completing, or integrating future acquisitions, and even successful acquisitions may not positively

## impact our business or results. We must also estimate the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, relying on valuation models

## with inherent uncertainties and our judgment regarding certain assumptions.

## Financial Risks

## Currency fluctuations affect our operating profits.

## Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the

## Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we

## develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland.

## When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings

### 20


## go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and

## Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings

## before tax by approximately $2.4 million to $2.7 million annually.

## We also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and

## Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of

## these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against

## the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.3 million to $2.6 million annually.

## In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange

## rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and the euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024, we

## estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of

## $39.0 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.

## Inflation can impact our operating results and the global economy.

## Inflation affects the costs of goods and services that we use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as

## transportation and logistical costs and other external costs and services. Inflation also affects labor costs, which are a significant element

## of our overall cost structure. If these costs cannot be passed on to customers, our margins could be reduced.

## Inflation also leads to increased interest rates as country monetary policies combat inflation. This can result in reduced economic

## growth and recessionary conditions, as well as higher borrowing costs.

## Global inflation significantly increased in 2022 and 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in

## global demand, supply chains/logistics, and labor markets, as well as the war in Ukraine and related significant increase in energy costs.

## While the global inflation rate began to ease in 2023 and 2024 as a result of central bank policy tightening, core inflation has proved

## persistent as a result of the preceding factors, in addition to others such as the escalating number of significant geopolitical conflicts

## throughout the world.

## These inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years. The pace of inflationary changes

## can also occur more quickly than our ability to respond with corresponding price increases and cost optimization or reduction measures.

## In addition, there may be differences in inflation rates between countries where we incur the major portion of our costs and other

## countries where we sell products, which may limit our ability to recover increased costs. The competitive environment in which we

## operate may also limit our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices.

## Historically, we also have experienced higher inflation in China, Eastern Europe, India, and Brazil. To date, these inflationary

## conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results. However, given our presence in China, Eastern Europe, India, and

## Brazil, these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results.

## We may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.

## As of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $668.9 million and other intangible assets of $257.1

## million.

### 21


## Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period

## amortization expense and possible impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect

## our consolidated financial statements.

## In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for

## impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be

## impaired. The evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a

## number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transaction and market data.

## There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant

## estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax

## rates, and discount rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.

## Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows,

## including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our

## reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment

## charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

## Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful

## lives change.

## Concerns regarding the Eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our

## operating profits.

## We conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency (the Eurozone). In the past, there have been concerns

## regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations. In addition, concerns in the

## past have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic

## and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries.

## These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in more extreme

## circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual

## consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential

## developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets

## and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could

## have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and, more specifically, on the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers, and

## lenders to finance their respective businesses and to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies

## and materials, and on the demand for our products. For information on the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the

## European Union, see "Risk Factors — Changes in foreign laws and legal systems could adversely impact our results of operations."

## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, and Other Risks

## Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.

## We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities

## are subject to the allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions. Our

### 22


## effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates (including the potential implementation

## of various U.S. tax proposals), changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and

## liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits.

## In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate

## future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and

## a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.

## Our tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing the application of tax law.

## Governments are facing greater pressure on public finances, which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws

## and regulations. Governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations.

## The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has proposed changes to the current transfer pricing arm’s

## length standard for allocating profit as well as a 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction. While the provision to alter the way profit is allocated

## by jurisdiction is not expected to impact the Company, the 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction may adversely impact the Company's global

## tax provision.

## Any changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations, on repatriation of dividends, earnings, share repurchases, or capital, or on

## transfer pricing, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate,

## could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden, which would negatively affect our profitability. Potential OECD

## changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as

## pharmaceutical and food manufacturing, which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting

## decline in our revenues and profitability.

## We may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new

## regulations.

## Our products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our

## products, including design and development, product safety, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. We also operate

## a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business, including those relating to

## competition, employment and labor practices, international trade, and corruption. If we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new

## regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practices or impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease

## their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to investigation costs, reputational harm, fines, criminal prosecution,

## and other damages that could impact our profitability.

## In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, ending judicial deference to regulatory agencies. This shift

## could significantly impact environmental regulation, consumer protection, advertising, privacy, artificial intelligence, and other regulatory

## frameworks we must comply with. This may impact our ability to operate our business in the manner in which we are accustomed and

## could negatively impact how we market our offerings, and could increase our regulatory compliance expense, which could in turn have a

## material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and results of operations. Political policies in the U.S., China, the U.K.,

## Canada, and Europe may affect global trade, domestic purchasing, or create uncertainty. In recent years, the U.S. government has taken a

## new approach to trade policy, renegotiating or potentially terminating agreements and imposing tariffs, particularly on

### 23


## Chinese goods. These tariffs could raise the cost of our products, components, and raw materials, impacting our gross margin. Higher

## prices may also reduce competitiveness and consumer demand.

## U.S. trade policy under the new administration, including potential new or increased tariffs, along with trade policies in China,

## Mexico, the U.K., Canada, and parts of Europe, may impact global trade and create uncertainty, potentially harming our business.

## Additionally, before taking office, President Trump pledged to impose 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports in his first year. In response,

## foreign governments, including China, have enacted retaliatory tariffs and domestic purchasing requirements favoring local competition,

## which could reduce our sales.

## The various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lower-cost countries in certain

## circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty, negatively impact global markets, and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our

## products into certain countries. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade

## agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn, increased inflation, and/or could create unfavorable fluctuations in

## currency exchange rates (see above description "Currency fluctuations affect our operating profits."). In times of uncertainty, some

## customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our sales. The adoption and

## expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs, trade agreements, or policies have the potential to adversely

## impact our business and financial performance.

## Changes in foreign laws and legal systems could adversely impact our results of operations.

## Following Brexit, the E.U.-U.K. Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) took effect on May 1, 2021, allowing tariff-free and

## quota-free trade. However, additional inspections and documentation requirements may cause delays at ports, potentially disrupting our

## supply chain and affecting delivery schedules.

## Uncertainty remains regarding the U.K.'s future relationship with the E.U. and the interpretation of the TCA, with Brexit-related

## issues likely to take years to resolve. While the full impact on our business is uncertain, Brexit could adversely affect our financial

## condition and operating results.

## If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our

## operating results could be harmed.

## Our success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks, and protect

## our trade secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire, and competitors may develop similar products that are

## not covered by our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed. We may experience a

## decline in sales and/or profitability if any of these things occur. Competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or

## brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand. Improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.

## We may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our profitability

## regardless of the outcome, and management attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such litigation, we may have to pay

## damages, stop the infringing activity, and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to sell some of our

## products, which could result in a decline in our revenues.

## We may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations.

## We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and

## regulations. For instance, federal, international, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies are increasingly focused on combating

## and/or limiting the effects of climate change

### 24


## through a variety of means, including regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, implementing policies mandating or promoting the

## use of renewable or zero-carbon energy and sustainability initiatives, and additional taxes on fuel and energy. We have corporate

## programs in place to manage compliance and stakeholder expectations related to environmental matters, but increasing public interest in

## climate change topics may result in the enactment of additional governmental laws and regulations related to this subject area. Such

## increased compliance burdens and costs could disrupt the sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution of our products and adversely affect

## our business, and financial condition, or results in operations. We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the

## remediation of past contamination in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades

## and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future.

## These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require

## remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm

## our results of operations or financial condition.

## Climate change, or the effects of climate change, may negatively affect us.

## Climate change risks and evolving stakeholder expectations could negatively impact our business. Climate-related changes may

## increase the frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as extreme weather events, wildfires, rising temperatures, and shifting

## precipitation patterns. These disruptions could affect our suppliers' ability to fulfill contracts due to workforce and infrastructure

## challenges, impacting material availability and costs. Additionally, rising insurance and operating expenses from climate-related

## disruptions could adversely affect our financial performance.

## We may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain, including

## conflict minerals.

## The SEC has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their

## derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold, known as conflict minerals. Companies must report annually whether or not such

## minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the

## sourcing, availability, and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we have incurred additional costs to

## comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our

## products. Since our supply chain is complex, due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we

## use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these

## minerals are DRC conflict free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers and other

## stakeholders who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these

## customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we

## source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs

## and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.

## Future laws, regulations, or customers may make additional demands on our supply chain, including more transparency into the

## activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing. We have significant protections in place to ensure we

## partner with responsible suppliers, but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs. If we cannot satisfy

## customers’ demands, we may lose business, and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements, we may have to alter our sourcing at

## increased expense.

### 25


## Our ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control.

## Our ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program, planned capital expenditures, and research and

## development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future. This is subject to factors beyond our control,

## including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, governmental, and other factors described in this section.

## We cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to

## us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to

## refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt,

## including our credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

## Our ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows. Changes

## in governmental cash repatriation policies, restrictions, or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program.

## Risks Related to Our Debt

## We have debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and

## may otherwise restrict our activities.

## We have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we had a total indebtedness of

## approximately $2.0 billion, net of cash of $59.4 million. Our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness.

## The existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to

## satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our

## indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development,

## and other corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in

## raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be

## necessary; and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is

## not waived or cured, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments.

## The agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business.

## The note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing

## various restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take

## advantage of potential business opportunities. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens

## and consolidate, merge, sell, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing

## our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios.

## Our ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial, and

## industry conditions. The breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing

## the senior notes and/or under our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our

## debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of our other

## indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.

### 26


## The lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments, reducing the amount of our

## borrowing capacity.

## We have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to $1.35

## billion. Our credit facility is provided by a group of 13 financial institutions, which individually have between 4.4% and 11.1% of the

## total funding commitment. At December 31, 2024, we had borrowings of $734.7 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability

## to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available.

## Even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial

## difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to borrow the full

## $1.35 billion amount available.

## General Risk Factors

## We make forward-looking statements, and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because

## assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors.

## We provide forward-looking statements both in our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls,

## including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share. You should not rely on forward-looking statements to predict our

## actual results. Our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forward-looking statements because of

## various risks and uncertainties.

## Our forward-looking statements may not be accurate or complete, and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual

## results. New risks also periodically arise. Please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what

## is described in our forward-looking statements. See in particular “Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results” and “Management’s

## Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

## In providing guidance on our future earnings, we evaluate our budgets, strategic plans, and other factors relating to our business. We

## make assumptions about external factors, including the following:

## • the outlook for our end markets and the global economy;

## • the impact of external factors on our competition;

## • the financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services;

## • the estimated costs of purchasing materials;

## • the estimated costs and performance of transportation and logistics, including third-party service providers;

## • developments in personnel costs;

## • our estimated income tax expense; and

## • rates for currency exchange, particularly between the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar and between the Swiss franc and the

## euro.

## These assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time. For example, although no single end-customer accounts for more than 1%

## of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced significant deterioration in their financial positions concurrently, it could have

## an impact on our results of operations.

### 27


## Some of our key internal assumptions include the following:

## • our ability to implement our business strategy;

## • our ability to implement price increases as forecasted;

## • the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our Spinnaker, market penetration, and Field Turbo initiatives;

## • the effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business, including growth, globalization, and productivity initiatives;

## • our ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services;

## • the continued growth of our sales in emerging markets; and

## • the effectiveness of our productivity and cost-saving initiatives.

## These internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our planned

## price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets, price tends to be a

## more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services. Furthermore, we can have no assurance that our

## cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to take additional restructuring

## actions resulting in additional restructuring costs.

## We believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions

## prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results different

## than our projections.

## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

## None.

## Item 1C. Cybersecurity

## We rely on our technology infrastructure and information systems to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill

## orders, support our customers, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our internally developed system and processes, as well as those

## systems and processes provided by third-party vendors, may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity threats, such as

## terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information,

## insider risk, or other security breaches. Such attacks have become more and more sophisticated over the years and in some cases have

## been conducted or sponsored by governmental actors with significant means. We have implemented robust processes to assess, identify,

## and manage cybersecurity risks, including potentially material risks, related to our internal information systems, our products, and our

## business. Our Board of Directors has direct oversight of our enterprise risk management process, including the management of

## cybersecurity risks, as described below.

## Under the direction and supervision of our Chief Financial Officer, we conduct an annual comprehensive enterprise risk

## assessment, which includes details of our management of enterprise-wide risk topics, such as those related to cybersecurity risks. The

## Board of Directors receives the full results of the annual enterprise risk assessment, including an evaluation of cybersecurity risks we

## face, risks more broadly across our peers and industries, and a detailed description of the actions we have taken to mitigate these risks.

## The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the results of the enterprise risk assessment in detail with management on an

## annual basis and reports on its review to the Board of Directors each year. We provide a comprehensive update to the Board of Directors

## on cybersecurity at least annually, and more frequently as relevant.

## Our Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, Chief Information Officer, and Head of Information Security serve on our

## Cybersecurity Steering Committee (the “Cyber SteCo”), along with our Chief Legal

### 28


## Officer, who reports to our Chief Executive Officer, and our Head of Financial Processes, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer. The

## Cyber SteCo, which meets regularly, develops and implements cybersecurity risk mitigation strategies and activities throughout the year,

## including the management of comprehensive incident response plans, and receives regular updates on cybersecurity-related matters.

## Our Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, reporting to our Chief Executive Officer, has principal responsibility for assessing and

## managing cybersecurity risks and preparing updates for the Board of Directors. Our Chief Information Officer reports to our Head of

## Global Supply Chain and IT and is responsible for the operation of our cybersecurity program. Our Chief Information Officer is educated

## in business computing sciences and has over twenty years working in leadership, management, and consulting roles in digitalization,

## application management, and cybersecurity. Our Chief Information Officer also has experience implementing and leading global

## governance frameworks, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and ISO

## 27001. An Advisory Board, comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Head of Global Supply Chain and IT, and

## Chief Information Officer, meets quarterly to discuss digital initiatives and investments, inclusive of cybersecurity topics. An experienced

## team of IT security professionals reports to our Chief Information Officer.

## The Cyber SteCo oversees activities related to the monitoring, prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation of cybersecurity

## risks. We have adopted the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework to continually evaluate

## and enhance our cybersecurity procedures. Activities include mandatory quarterly online training for all employees, technical security

## controls, enhanced data protection, the maintenance of backup and protective systems, policy review and implementation, the evaluation

## and retention of cybersecurity insurance, and periodic assessments of third-party service providers to assess the cyber preparedness of key

## vendors. To enhance our threat preparedness, we perform monthly vulnerability scans, annual penetration testing with a third party, and

## annual disaster recovery and cyber response drills, including third-party-facilitated drills. We use automated tools that monitor, detect,

## and prevent cybersecurity risks and have a third party operated security operations center that operates 24 hours a day to alert us to any

## potential cybersecurity threats. As noted above, our Cyber SteCo also has implemented comprehensive incident response plans that define

## the appropriate communication flow and response for certain categories of potential cybersecurity incidents. The Cyber SteCo escalates

## events, including to the Chief Executive Officer and Board of Directors, as deemed necessary.

## The Cyber SteCo oversees our engagement with reputable third parties, which we utilize in connection with our established

## processes to assess, identify, and manage potential and actual cybersecurity threats, to actively monitor our systems internally using

## widely accepted digital applications, processes, and controls, and to provide forensic assistance to facilitate system recovery in the case of

## an incident.

## If there is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality. Many of

## our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident

## could cause. Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and

## misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers

## could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage. Customers may use our products and/or software to generate

## or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack

## could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or

## compromise of critical information, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation

### 29


## and financial condition as it could cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events.

## Item 2. Properties

## Our principal executive offices are located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland. The following table lists our principal

## facilities, indicating the location and whether the facility is owned or leased. The properties listed below serve primarily as manufacturing

## facilities or shared service centers and also typically have a certain amount of space for service, sales and marketing, and administrative

## activities. The facilities in Giessen, Germany, Viroflay, France, and Salford, United Kingdom are used primarily for sales and marketing.

## We believe our facilities are adequate for our current and reasonably anticipated future needs.

## Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

## The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our

## consolidated financial statements.

## Changes in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by

## translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We

## believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between

## periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a

## substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our

## financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.

## We also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of

## such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.

## Overview

## We operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region, product range, and customer. We hold leading

## positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors, including the strength of our brand name and

## reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, and the

## breadth and quality of our global sales and service network.

## Net sales in U.S. dollars increased 2% in 2024 and decreased 3% in 2023. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate

## fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 3% in 2024 and decreased 3% in 2023. Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted

## by approximately $58 million from our previously disclosed shipping delays related to a new external European logistics service

## provider, which were largely recovered in the first quarter of 2024. We estimate local currency net sales were flat in 2024 and decreased

## 1% in 2023 excluding the impact of the delayed shipments. Market demand in our core segments was soft in 2024, particularly in China.

## We continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions, diversified customer base, innovative product offering, investment in

## emerging markets, significant installed base, and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs. Examples of these

## programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities, more effectively pricing our products and

## services, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth

## opportunities, increasing the use of digital tools, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes.

## In addition to soft market demand during 2024, we also continued to experience uncertainty in the economic environment, including

## the risk of recession in many countries, and unfavorable foreign currency. Our team’s resilience and agility, and our productivity and cost

## savings initiatives, were critical to our ability to mitigate these challenges. Over the past few years, we also accelerated our ability to use

## advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities, while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our

## global sales organization. We also have continued to increase engagement with our customers with our Go-to-Market and digital

## approaches. Our market-leading solutions and ability to leverage our innovative portfolio have also allowed us to quickly capitalize on

## our customers' demand for automation and digitalization solutions and faster growing segments. We are well positioned, and have

## continued to make investments to further strengthen our portfolio and capture future growth opportunities. Our service business also

## delivered very strong results in 2024 as we have been able to support our customers’ ability to maintain uptime, improve productivity, and

## comply with regulatory requirements.

## As we enter 2025, we expect to continue to benefit from market trends toward automation and digitalization, as well as customer

## investments in on/near-shoring activities. However, many of our end-markets, including pharma/biopharmaceutical, food, and chemical,

## remain challenged after significant growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, market conditions and challenges remain

## uncertain relating to the macro environment and global economy, including the impacts of the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle

## East and increasing geopolitical tensions. Market conditions also may change quickly.

## Our laboratory sales grew in 2024 despite a decrease in China as the sharp market decline in 2023 continued during 2024. We

## believe we will benefit from favorable pharma/biopharma market trends in the future. We also believe we will continue to benefit from

## increased customer demand for automation, digitalization, and safety; new facility investments; and continued focus on regulatory

## compliance including data integrity requirements. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain

## market share in our laboratory business.

### 35


## Our industrial sales grew modestly in 2024 despite challenging market conditions for core industrial in China. We continue to

## benefit from our strong product offering and focus on the more attractive, faster-growing segments of the market and strong execution of

## our growth initiatives in each region. We also continue to benefit from market trends in automation and digitalization and also expect to

## benefit from customer on/near-shoring activities in the future. Our core industrial-related products are also especially sensitive to changes

## in economic growth. China and emerging market economies have historically been an important source of growth based upon the

## expansion of their domestic economies, and we expect this to also be a source of long-term growth. Product inspection experienced solid

## growth in 2024, and we expect our product inspection end-market to continue to benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection,

## food safety, and productivity.

## Our food retailing sales decreased significantly during 2024 primarily due to strong project activity in 2023, especially in the

## Americas. Traditionally, the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other end-markets due to the timing

## of customer project activity and new regulations.

## In 2025, we will continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:

## Gaining Market Share. Innovation is essential to gaining market share and is fundamental in all aspects of our business including

## sales and marketing and technology leadership. Our global sales and marketing initiative, Spinnaker, continues to be an important growth

## strategy. We aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs, leveraging our extensive customer

## databases, product offering, and installed base. While this initiative is broad-based, efforts to improve these processes include the use of

## advanced data analytics to identify, prioritize, and pursue growth opportunities; the implementation of more effective pricing related to

## value-based selling strategies and processes; improved sales force guidance, training, and effectiveness; cross-selling; increased segment

## marketing; and leads generation and nurturing activities. We also have added resources to pursue under-penetrated market opportunities

## and continue to adapt our Go-to-Market approaches with additional inside and telesales resources, while also increasing digital customer

## interaction. We continue to benefit from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force.

## In addition, our comprehensive service offerings, and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings, help us further

## penetrate developed markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world, and we continue

## to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is

## under service contract, or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base. In addition to traditional repair and

## maintenance, our service offerings continue to expand into value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory

## compliance. We have also improved our service model to incorporate remote service, depot drop-off/pickup, and other approaches.

## Faster-Growing Markets. Emer ging markets, comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East,

## and Africa, account for approximately 34% of our total net sales of which 16% relates to China. We have a two-pronged strategy in

## emerging markets: first, to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in these markets, and second, to leverage our low-cost

## manufacturing operations in China. We have more than a 35-year track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than 10%

## on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999. Over the years, we also have broadened our product offering to the

## Asian markets. India has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research

## activities. Overall, versus the prior year, we experienced a 1% decrease in emerging market local currency sales by destination during

## 2024, which included an 11% local currency sales decline in China and a 10% local currency sales increase in other emerging markets.

## Following particularly strong growth in 2022 and 2021, market conditions in

### 36


## China declined significantly during the second half of 2023, and challenging market conditions persisted in 2024. Going forward, we

## continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to pharma, food manufacturing, chemical, and new energy. We believe the

## long-term growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the Chinese government’s emphasis on science, high-value industries,

## product quality, and food safety. We expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on

## these segments. We also continue to pursue growth in under-penetrated emerging markets. However, emerging market sales can be

## volatile as we experienced in China over the past several years. China has historically been volatile, and market conditions may change

## unfavorably due to various factors. In addition to China and emerging markets, we also pursue other faster-growth vertical markets.

## While rather small, these markets present outsized growth potential. Segments include semiconductors, advanced materials, and new

## energy. The components of these faster-growing segments will change as various markets develop, and we will continue to leverage the

## breadth and scope of our product offering as new opportunities emerge.

## Extending Our Technology Lead. We continue to focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent approximately 5% of

## net sales on research and development, reflecting a total of $551 million. We seek to improve our product offerings and their capabilities

## with additional integrated technologies and software, which we believe supports our pricing differentiation and accelerates product

## replacement cycles. In addition, we aim to create value for our customers by having thorough knowledge of their processes via our

## significant installed product base.

## Expanding Our Margins. We continue to strive to improve our margins by enhancing our value proposition via innovation, more

## effectively pricing our products and services, optimizing our cost structure, and improving our mix in higher-margin businesses such as

## service. For example, sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes. We

## have also implemented productivity and cost savings initiatives over the past two years to mitigate our reduced volume, while also

## focusing on reallocating resources to better align our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives, higher-

## growth/profitable areas, and opportunities for margin improvement.

## We also have implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at

## lowering costs and have increased our focus on these programs with our SternDrive initiative. SternDrive is our global operational

## excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain, manufacturing, and back-office operations. Blue Ocean

## is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives. Our move to standardized business processes, systems, and data

## structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to real-time data. Our cost leadership

## and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as reducing our working

## capital levels, improving our order to cash cycle, and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures.

## Pursuing Strategic Acquisitions. We seek to pursue "bolt-on" acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network,

## respected brand, extensive distribution channels, and technological leadership. We have identified life sciences and process analytics as

## key areas for acquisitions. For example, in 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a

## manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data

## collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is

## located in the United States. In 2021, we also acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction

## modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets.

## Results of Operations — Consolidated

## Net sales

## Net sales were $3.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared to $3.8 billion in 2023 and $3.9 billion in 2022. This

## represents an increase of 2% in 2024 and a decrease of 3% in 2023 in U.S. dollars and an increase of 3% in 2024 and a decrease of 3% in

## 2023 in local currencies. Net sales in 2023 were negatively impacted by approximately $58 million from our previously disclosed

## shipping delays related to a new external European logistics service provider, which were largely recovered in the first quarter of 2024.

## We estimate local currency net sales were flat in 2024 and decreased approximately 1% in 2023 excluding the impact of the delayed

## shipments. In 2024, we experienced soft market demand, particularly in China. We continue to benefit from the execution of our global

## sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital

## tools and techniques. However, there continues to be uncertainty in our end-markets, the economic environment and geopolitics, and

## market conditions may change quickly.

## In 2024, our net sales by geographic destination increased in U.S. dollars compared to 2023 by 8% in Europe, 2% in the Americas,

## and decreased by 3% in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2024 by 8% in

## Europe, 3% in the Americas, and decreased by 1% in Asia/Rest of World, with an 11% decline in China. A discussion of sales by

## operating segment is included below.

## As described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and

## related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification,

## calibration, certification, preventative maintenance, and spare parts.

## Net sales of products increased 1% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024 and decreased 7% in U.S. dollars and 6%

## in local currencies in 2023. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2024 and

## increased 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2023.

## Net sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56% of our total net sales in 2024, increased 6%

## in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024. Laboratory net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 4% and were reduced by 2%

## in 2023 from the previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency increase in net sales of our laboratory-related products during

## 2024 includes an increase in most product categories, especially analytical instruments. Laboratory results were also negatively impacted

## by a decline in China.

## Net sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 39% of our total net sales in 2024, were flat in

## U.S. dollars and increased 1% in local currencies during 2024. Industrial net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 1% and were reduced

## by 1% in 2023 from the previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency increase in net sales of our industrial-related products

## during 2024 includes solid growth in product inspection, offset in part by a decline in core-industrial products, especially in China.

## Net sales of our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 5% of our total net sales in 2024, decreased

## 14% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies during 2024. Retail net sales in 2024 benefited approximately 3% and were reduced by 2%

## in 2023 from previously disclosed shipping delays. The local currency decrease in net sales of our food retailing products during 2024

## related to particularly strong project activity in 2023, especially in the Americas.

### 38


## Gross profit

## Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 60.1% for 2024, 59.2% for 2023, and 58.9% for 2022.

## Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 62.1% for 2024, compared to 60.6% for both 2023 and 2022. Gross profit

## as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 53.7% for 2024, compared to 54.3% for 2023 and 52.0% for 2022.

## The gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2024 primarily reflects favorable price realization that benefits from our innovative

## product portfolio, benefits from our productivity, and cost savings initiatives and business mix, offset in part by investments in our

## service organization.

## Research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses

## Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.9% for 2024, compared to 4.9% for 2023, and 4.5% for

## 2022. Research and development expenses in U.S. dollars increased 2% in 2024 and 5% in 2023, and in local currencies increased 2% in

## 2024 and 3% in 2023.

## Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 24.2% for 2024, compared to 23.9% for both 2023

## and 2022. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 4% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2024 and decreased 4%

## in both U.S. dollars and local currencies in 2023. The increase during 2024 primarily includes higher variable compensation, offset in part

## by benefits from our cost savings initiatives.

## Amortization expense

## Amortization expense was $72.9 million in 2024, compared to $72.2 million and $66.2 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The

## increase in amortization expense during 2024 relates to our investments in information technology, primarily from our Blue Ocean

## program.

## Restructuring charges

## During the past few years, we initiated various cost reduction measures. Restructuring charges were $19.8 million in 2024,

## compared to $32.7 million and $9.6 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-

## related costs.

## Other charges (income), net

## Other charges (income), net consisted of net income of $4.6 million, $4.1 million, and $9.3 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022,

## respectively. Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency

## transactions and hedging activities, interest income, and other items. Non-service pension benefits were $7.7 million, $7.6 million, and

## $16.9 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other charges (income), net also includes acquisition costs, for which there were

## $0.3 million in 2024 and $0.9 million in 2022.

## Interest expense and taxes

## Interest expense was $74.6 million in 2024, compared to $77.4 million in 2023 and $55.4 million in 2022. The decrease in interest

## expense is primarily related to lower debt levels throughout the year.

## Our reported tax rate was 16.8% in 2024, compared to 19.0% and 18.5% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The reported tax rate in

## 2024 includes a non-cash discrete tax benefit of $23 million resulting from the reduction of uncertain tax position liabilities related to the

## settlement of a tax audit.

## Other Operations includes reporting units in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and other countries. Total net sales in

## U.S. dollars increased 8% in 2024 and 6% in 2023, and in local currencies increased 10% in 2024 and 7% in 2023. Net sales to external

## customers in U.S. dollars increased 8% in 2024 and 4% in 2023, and in local currencies increased 10% in 2024 and 5% in 2023. Net sales

## to external customers benefited approximately 4% in 2024 and were reduced by approximately 2% in 2023 from the previously disclosed

## shipping delays in 2023. The increase in local currency growth in net sales to external customers during 2024 includes strong growth in

## most product categories.

## Segment profit increased $17.9 million in our Other Operations segment during 2024, compared to an increase of $15.9 million

## during 2023. The increase in segment profit during 2024 primarily relates to increased sales volume and our margin expansion initiatives,

## offset in part by unfavorable foreign currency translation.

## Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Future Cash Requirements

## Liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments. Sources of liquidity include cash flows

## from operating activities, available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing, and our cash and

## cash equivalent balances. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital

## expenditures, share repurchases, and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could

## be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.

## We currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local

## working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending

## requirements for at least the foreseeable future.

## Cash provided by operating activities totaled $968.3 million in 2024, compared to $965.9 million in 2023 and $859.1 million in

## 2022. The increase in 2024 is primarily related to favorable working capital, including lower cash incentive payments of $35 million.

## Capital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment, and the

## purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $103.9 million in 2024, $105.3 million in 2023, and $121.2 million

## in 2022. Capital expenditures in 2025 are expected to be relatively consistent with previous years subject to business and economic

## conditions.

## In September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production

## capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. We received the maximum allowable funding of $35.8

## million related to the agreement during prior years, which offset associated capital expenditures.

## We continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In 2024,

## 2023, and 2022, we incurred acquisition payments totaling $10.1 million, $5.8 million, and $38.0 million, respectively. In addition, the

## Company paid $10.0 million for contingent consideration relating to the PendoTECH acquisition in both 2023 and 2022. In 2022, $7.9

## million is included in financing activities and $2.1 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition

## date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In 2023, the final contingent consideration payment was made of which $5.6 million

## is included in financing activities for the amount accrued at the acquisition date and $4.4 million is included in operating activities for the

## amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

## Cash flows used in financing activities during 2024 primarily comprised share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase

## program, we spent $850.0 million in 2024 and $900.0 million and $1.1 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively, on the repurchase of

## 645,139 shares, 691,913 shares, and 838,010 shares, respectively. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any

## specific number of shares; however, in 2025, we intend to spend approximately $875 million on the repurchase of shares, subject to

## business and economic conditions.

## The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was enacted in August, 2022. The IRA includes provisions imposing a 1% excise tax on net share

## repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial

## statement income. The financial impact of the IRA is immaterial to our financial statements.

## We plan to continue to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in

## future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes. All

## other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. We believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating

## our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity.

```
## As of December 31, 2024, approximately $615.3 million of additional borrowings were available under our Credit Agreement and

## we maintained $59.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2024, the interest payments associated with 73% of the

## Company’s debt are fixed obligations. We expect to make interest payments of approximately $72.0 million during 2025 associated with

## our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

## Changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are

## denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in

## exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt.

## We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2024.

## Senior Notes

## The Senior Notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes each contain

## customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

## In January 2025, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell EUR 100 million 10 1/2-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate

## of 3.80% (3.8% Euro Senior Notes) in a private placement, which will

## mature in July 2035. We used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate

## purposes.

## In December 2022, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $150 million 10-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We

## issued $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 5.45% (5.45% Senior Notes) in March 2023, which will mature in March 2033. We used

## the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.

## Credit Agreement

## On May 30, 2024, we entered into a $1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our $1.25 billion

## Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), which is further described in Note 10 to our consolidated

## financial statements.

## Other Local Arrangements

## In April 2018, two of our non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly-owned

## subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5 basis

## points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2024.

## Share Repurchase Program

## The Company has $1.7 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program as of December 31, 2024. The share

## repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be

## made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the

## stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.

## We have purchased 32.4 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through December 31, 2024, at a total

## cost of $9.8 billion and average price per share of $302.60. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we spent $850.0

## million and $900 million on the repurchase of 645,139 shares and 691,913 shares at an average price per share of $1,317.52 and

## $1,300.72, respectively. We reissued 68,428 shares and 79,076 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted

## stock units during 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, we incurred $7.8 million and $8.1 million of excise tax during the years

## ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Inflation Reduction Act which is reflected as a reduction in shareholders'

## equity in our consolidated financial statements.

## Effect of Currency on Results of Operations

## Our earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the

## Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we

## develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland.

## When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We

## also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our

## earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by

## approximately $2.4 million to $2.7 million annually.

## We also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and

## Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of

## these currency exposures is the Chinese

### 45


## renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of

## approximately $2.3 million to $2.6 million annually.

## In addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange

## rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024, we estimate

## that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $39.0

## million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.

## Taxes

## We are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a

## number of factors, such as changes in law, the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax

## treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions, and earnings repatriations between

## jurisdictions. Generally, the tax liability for each taxpayer within the Mettler-Toledo International Inc. group of companies is determined

## either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to

## tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.

## Environmental Matters

## We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of

## properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur,

## capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.

## In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of

## these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible

## that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become

## the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to

## date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to

## additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations,

## or cash flows.

## Inflation

## Global inflation continued to moderate during 2024, after rising sharply in 2022 and 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic

## recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, supply chains/logistics, and labor markets, as well as the war in Ukraine and

## related significant increase in energy costs and the conflict in the Middle East. Inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we

## use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as transportation and logistical costs and other external costs and

## services. Inflation can also affect labor costs which are a significant element of our overall cost structure. Inflation can also lead to

## increased interest rates as country monetary policies combat inflation. This can result in reduced economic growth and recessionary

## conditions, as well as higher borrowing costs. Inflation presents several risks to our business as further described on page 21 in the Risk

## Factors section of this Form 10-K, and these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years.

### 46


## Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

## We have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.

## We have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements. The fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $3.2 million at

## December 31, 2024. Based on our agreements outstanding at December 31, 2024, a 100-basis-point change in interest rates and foreign

## currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately $7.0 million.

## Any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were

## prematurely settled.

## Critical Accounting Estimates

## Management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial

## statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires

## us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of

## contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, income taxes,

## inventories, goodwill and intangibles, leases, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical

## experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for

## making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may

## differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

## We believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our

## consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our

## consolidated financial statements.

## Income taxes

## Income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment

## of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our

## deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance of $73.2 million as of December 31,

## 2024 is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. In the event we were to

## determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the

## valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we

## would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged

## to income in the period such determination was made.

## We plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years

## and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be non-U.S. withholding taxes, certain state

## taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any. All other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.

## The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective

## tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, or

## should our income mix from our geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Based on earnings

## before taxes of $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, each increase of $10.4 million in tax expense would increase our

## effective tax rate by 1%.

### 47


## Employee benefit plans

## The net periodic pension cost for 2024 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 were $3.0 million and $99.9

## million, respectively, for our U.S. pension plan. The net periodic cost for 2024 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024

## were $7.2 million and $924.9 million, respectively, for our international pension plans. The expected post-retirement benefit obligation as

## of December 31, 2024 for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan was $0.5 million.

## Pension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations.

## The most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP,

## actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While management believes the

## assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future

## expense.

## The expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and

## the long-term projected return of those assets, which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international corporate equities and

## government and corporate debt securities. In 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical

## program for certain current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For

## 2024, the weighted average return on assets assumption was 6.75% for the U.S. plan and 4.06% for the international plans. A change in

## the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $8.7 million after tax.

## The discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds. For

## 2024, the weighted average discount rate assumption was 5.34% for the U.S. plan and 1.57% for the international plans, representing a

## weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A change in the discount rate of 1% would impact annual benefit plan

## expense by approximately $8.5 million after tax.

## Goodwill and other intangible assets

## As of December 31, 2024, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $668.9 million and other intangible assets of $257.1

## million.

## Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period

## amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to

## make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.

## In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for

## impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be

## impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative

## factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.

## If we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of

## events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the

## respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset. If

## the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the

## difference is recognized.

### 48


## Both the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results, business plans, economic conditions, and market data,

## among other factors. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment

## analyses. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.

## Should any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows,

## including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our

## reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment

## charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.

## Our amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful

## lives change.

## Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

## Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal

## control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and

## the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally

## accepted in the United States of America.

## Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,

## projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of

## changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

### 49


## Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In

## making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission

## (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the

## Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.

## PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this

## Report on Form 10-K, has issued their integrated audit report, which covers our internal control over financial reporting, which appears

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

**_Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash

flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying
accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 appearing on page S-1 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated
financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as

of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all

material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

**_Basis for Opinions_**

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial
reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control

over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and
on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated

financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a
test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting

principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.
Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the
risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.
Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.

### F-2


**_Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting_**

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s

internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are

recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

**_Critical Audit Matters_**

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was

communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the
consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit

matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the
critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

_Product Revenue Recognition_
As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has
obtained control of a product. The Company considers control to have transferred based upon shipping terms. As described in Note 3, for the year
ended December 31, 2024, the Company’s net sales were $3.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion relate to product revenue. The principal consideration for
our determination that performing procedures relating to product revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of auditor effort in
performing procedures related to product revenue recognition. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in
connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls
relating to the product revenue recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, testing the appropriateness of product revenue

recognized for a sample of product revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting evidence of arrangement, evidence of products delivered, and,
where applicable, consideration received in exchange for those products.

## 1. BUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

## Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (Mettler-Toledo or the Company) is a leading global supplier of precision instruments and services.

## The Company manufactures weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, packaging, logistics, and food retailing applications.

## The Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and

## chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line inspection

## systems used in production and packaging and provides solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The Company’s

## primary manufacturing facilities are located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. The

## Company’s principal executive offices are located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland.

## The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United

## States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include all entities in which the Company has control, which are its wholly owned subsidiaries.

## The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions

## that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial

## statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those

## estimates due to uncertainty around the ongoing developments related to Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, as well as other

## factors. A discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

## included within this filing.

## All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

## 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

## Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less. The carrying value

## of these cash equivalents approximates fair value.

## Trade Accounts Receivable

## Trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for expected credit losses

## represents the Company’s best estimate based on current and historical information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future

## events and circumstances.

## Inventories

## Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor, and overhead, is

## generally determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future

## demand and related pricing. Adjustments to the cost basis of the Company’s inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on

## usage, expected future orders, and technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by

## management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required.

## Long-Lived Assets

## a) Property, Plant, and Equipment

## Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to

## expense as incurred. The Company capitalizes certain direct costs related to the acquisition and development of internal-use computer

## software. Externally purchased software is capitalized when we obtain legal ownership and is amortized over its useful life ranging from

## three to five years. Internally developed software costs for internal use are capitalized once the preliminary project stage is complete and

## it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs associated with

## internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally

## developed software are retained in property, plant, and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal.

## Depreciation and amortization are charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

## Buildings and improvements 15 to 50 years

## Machinery and equipment 3 to 12 years

## Computer software 3 to 10 years

## Leasehold improvements Shorter of useful life or lease term

## In September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production

## capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. We have received the maximum allowable funding of $35.8

## million related to the agreement during prior years, which offset associated capital expenditures. In accordance with ASU 2021-10:

## Government Assistance, the Company applies guidance within IAS 20 - Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure and accounts

## for the government agreement by reducing the cost of the asset within property, plant, and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets

## by the amount of the funds received.

## b) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

## Goodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived

## intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or

## changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible

## assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the

## asset is less than its carrying amount.

## If the Company is unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the

## totality of events and circumstances during its qualitative assessment, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by estimating the

## fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount. If the

## carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the

## difference is recognized.

## Other intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets and assets subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is charged

## on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate

## allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in

## each reporting period. The Company assesses the initial acquisition of intangible assets in accordance with the provisions

## of ASC 805 - Business Combinations and the continued accounting for previously recognized intangible assets and goodwill in

## accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 - Intangible - Goodwill and Other and ASC 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment.

## Accounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

## The Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets (asset group) with finite lives when events or

## changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized

## when future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use and eventually disposition of that asset (asset group) are less

## than the asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured as the difference between carrying value and estimated fair value.

## Taxation

## The Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the

## future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities,

## their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted

## tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management

## considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation

## allowance is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law.

## Deferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these

## earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries or upon the

## remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary earnings to be permanently

## invested, such as in situations where the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend distributions.

## In accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company treats taxes due on future Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income

## (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.

## The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax

## expense within its consolidated statement of operations.

## Currency Translation and Transactions

## The reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the

## Company’s operations is generally the applicable local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional

## currency is other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the

## reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash flows of such

## non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated at the monthly weighted average exchange rates during the year. Translation

## gains or losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity. Transaction

## gains and losses are included as a component of net earnings or in certain circumstances as a component of other comprehensive income

## (loss) where the underlying item is considered a hedge of a net investment or relates to intercompany notes that are long term in nature.

## Revenue Recognition

## Product revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product. The Company

## considers control to have transferred based upon shipping terms. To the extent the Company’s contracts have a separate performance

## obligation, revenue related to any post-shipment performance obligation is deferred until completed. Shipping and handling costs charged

## to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales. Certain products are also sold

## through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the end-customer. Revenue is recognized

## on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor. Contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that

## are retrospective, except for rebate programs. Rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the

## time such revenue is recognized. The Company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and

## conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. The related provisions for estimated returns and rebates are

## immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

## Certain of the Company’s product arrangements include separate performance obligations, primarily related to installation. Such

## performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have stand-alone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered

## performance obligations is probable and within the Company’s control. The allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is

## based on the observable stand-alone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service

## technician billing rates, time to install, and geographic location.

## Software is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of small software

## applications. The Company primarily sells software products with the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the

## product. The Company’s products typically require no significant production, modification, or customization of the hardware or software

## that is essential to the functionality of the products.

## Service revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed. Revenue from spare parts sold on a

## stand-alone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery.

## Revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a time-based method. These contracts represent an

## obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, and preventative

## maintenance on a customer’s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.

## Leases

## The Company considers an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in

## exchange for consideration. The Company has operating leases, but does not have material financing leases.

## Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the

## obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the

## lease based upon the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments include both lease and non-lease

## components for items or activities that transfer a good or service. Vehicle lease and non-lease components are separately accounted for

## based on stand-alone value. Real estate lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single component. Operating lease right-

## of-use assets include initial direct costs, advanced lease payments, and lease incentives.

```
## The lease term reflects the noncancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the

## lease when management is reasonably certain that it will exercise such option. The Company applies its incremental borrowing rate at the

## lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments as the information necessary to determine the rate implicit

## in the lease is not readily available. The incremental borrowing rate reflects similar terms by geographic location to the underlying leases.

## The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

## Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments consist of non-

## lease services related to the lease. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use asset and lease liabilities and are expensed

## as incurred. Short-term leases are less than one year without purchase or renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised and

## are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.

## Research and Development

## Research and development costs primarily consist of salaries, consulting, and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as

## incurred.

## Restructuring Charges

## Restructuring charges include costs associated with exit and disposal activities including employee termination benefits, contract

## termination, and other costs associated with various cost saving initiatives undertaken by the Company.

## In situations where contractual termination benefits exist, the Company records accruals for employee termination benefits when it is

## probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. All other employee termination

## arrangements are recognized and measured at their fair value at the communication date unless the employee is required to render

## additional service beyond the legal notification period, in which case the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period.

## Earnings per Common Share

## In accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has included 98,803, 123,406, and 226,500 common equivalent shares

## in the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022,

## respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.

## Outstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase or receive 61,040, 54,840, and 42,855 shares of common stock for the

## years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average

## number of common and common equivalent shares as such options and restricted stock units would be anti-dilutive.

## Equity-Based Compensation

## The Company applies the fair value methodology in accounting for its equity-based compensation plan.

## Derivative Financial Instruments

## The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. As

## described more fully in Note 6, the Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge

## certain short-term intercompany balances involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the Company’s exposure to currency

## fluctuations on the underlying hedged item. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as of each balance sheet date, with the

## resulting changes in fair value being recognized in other charges (income), consistent with the underlying hedged item.

## The Company also enters into interest rate swap agreements and cross currency swaps in order to manage its exposure to changes in

## interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is recognized as incurred in interest expense over the life

## of the hedge agreements. Floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of

## outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are effective as cash flow hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income

## as incurred.

## Fair Value Measurements

## The Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for

## assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the

## price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the

## measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the

## Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market

## participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the fair value hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP and

## when possible looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets and liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are not

## traded in active markets, the Company looks to observable market data for similar assets and liabilities.

## Business Combinations and Asset Acquisitions

## The Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. The results of each

## acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated

## to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values and any consideration in excess of the net

## assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Acquisition transaction costs are expensed when incurred.

## In circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to

## the fair value of the expected contingent payments as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent

## consideration are recorded to other charges (income), net.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

## In March 2020, January 2021, and December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, ASU 2021-01, and ASU 2022-06: Reference

## Rate Reform, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other

## transactions affected by the discontinuance of LIBOR or another referenced rate. The guidance may be applied to any applicable contract

## entered into before December 31, 2024. During the period ended December 31, 2023, the Company amended its credit agreement and

## cross currency swap agreements to change the interest rate benchmark from LIBOR to

## SOFR and other non-U.S. dollar references, which did not change the amount or timing of cash flows. As a result, the discontinuation of

## LIBOR in June 2023 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements.

## In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires incremental

## disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments but does not change the definition of a segment or the guidance for determining

## reportable segments. The Company adopted these annual disclosure requirements on a retrospective basis in 2024. See Note 18 for the

## required reportable segments disclosures.

## In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which enhances income tax

## disclosures, especially related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The Company will adopt the annual disclosure

## requirements in 2025 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

## In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires disclosures

## about the nature of expenses presented on the face of the income statement. The Company will adopt the annual disclosure requirements

## in 2027 and is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.

## The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by product, service, timing of revenue recognition, and

## The Company's global revenue mix by product category for the year ended December 31, 2024 is laboratory (56% of sales),

## industrial (39% of sales), and retail (5% of sales). The Company’s product revenue by reportable segment is proportionately similar to the

## Company’s global mix with the exception of the Company’s Swiss Operations, which is largely comprised of laboratory products, and the

## Company’s Chinese Operations, which has a slightly higher percentage of industrial products. A breakdown of the Company’s sales by

## product category for the year ended December 31 follows:

```
2024 2023 2022
Laboratory $ 2,185,979 $ 2,068,807 $ 2,230,381

## The payment terms in the Company’s contracts with customers do not exceed one year and therefore contracts do not contain a

## significant financing component. In most cases, after appropriate credit evaluations, payments are due in arrears and are recognized as

## receivables. Unbilled revenue is recorded when performance obligations have been satisfied, but not yet billed to the customer. Unbilled

## revenue as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $32.6 million and $35.7 million, respectively, and is included within accounts receivable.

## Deferred revenue and customer prepayments are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of the performance

## obligation being satisfied. Deferred revenue primarily includes prepaid service contracts, as well as deferred installation.

## Changes in the components of deferred revenue and customer prepayments during the period are as follows:

```
2024 2023 2022
Beginning balances as of January 1 $ 202,022 $ 192,759 $ 192,648

## The Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the contract period is one year or less. These costs are

## recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. The value of unsatisfied performance obligations other than customer

## prepayments and deferred revenue associated with contracts greater than one year is immaterial.

## 4. ACQUISITIONS

## In 2024, the Company incurred acquisition payments totaling $10.1 million. The Company recorded $2.5 million of identified

## intangibles primarily pertaining to technology in connection with these acquisitions, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over

## 5 years. Goodwill recorded in connection with these acquisitions totaled $5.9 million.

## In 2023 and 2022, the Company also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling $5.8 million and $38.0 million, respectively,

## associated with other immaterial acquisitions.

## In March 2021, the Company acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and

## distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in

## bioprocess applications. The initial cash payment was $185.0 million and the Company made other post-closing payments of

## $7.4 million, as well as additional consideration of $20.0 million.

## The Company paid $10.0 million for contingent consideration in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, $7.9 million is included in financing

## activities and $2.1 million is included in operating activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated

## Statement of Cash Flows. In 2023, the final contingent consideration payment was made relating to the PendoTECH acquisition of which

## $5.6 million is included in financing activities for the amount accrued at the acquisition date and $4.4 million is included in operating

## activities for the amount not accrued at the acquisition date on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

## 5. INVENTORIES

## Inventories consisted of the following at December 31:

```
2024 2023
Raw materials and parts $ 161,416 $ 180,352
Work-in-progress 69,488 81,181
Finished goods 111,370 124,332
Total inventory $ 342,274 $ 385,865
```
## 6. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

## The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The

## Company enters into certain interest rate and cross currency swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates.

## The amount of the Company’s fixed obligation interest payments may change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate and cross

## currency swap agreement and the level and composition of its debt. The Company also enters into certain foreign currency forward

## contracts to limit the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the respective hedged items. For additional disclosures on

## derivative instruments regarding balance sheet location, fair value, and the amounts reclassified into other comprehensive income and the

## effective portion of the cash flow hedges, also see Note 7 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. As also mentioned in

```
## Note 10, the Company has designated its euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in a euro-denominated

## foreign subsidiary.

## Cash Flow Hedges

## The Company has entered into a number of cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges. The agreements convert

## borrowings under the Company’s credit facility into synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the

## floating rate SOFR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income or expense as follows:

```
Agreement Date
```
```
Amount
Converted
```
```
Effective Swiss Franc
Interest Rate Maturity Date
June 2019 $50 million (0.82)% June 2023
November 2021 $50 million (0.67)% November 2023
June 2021 $50 million (0.73)% June 2024
June 2021 $50 million (0.59)% June 2025
December 2023 $50 million 1.04% November 2026
November 2023 $50 million 1.16% November 2026
June 2023 $50 million 1.55% June 2027
June 2024 $50 million 1.15% June 2027
```
## The Company amended all active cross currency swap agreements in 2023 to replace all references of LIBOR to SOFR as the

## interest rate benchmark to align with the amendment to the Company's Credit Facility Agreement, as discussed in Note 10 to the

## consolidated financial statements. As part of these amendments, the corresponding fixed Swiss franc interest rates were amended as well

## to reflect the change in the benchmark.

## The Company’s cash flow hedges are recorded gross at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023

## and are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. A derivative gain of $5.5 million based upon interest rates at

## December 31, 2024 is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next 12 months. Through

## December 31, 2024, no hedge ineffectiveness has occurred in relation to these cash flow hedges.

## Other Derivatives

## The Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to economically hedge short-term intercompany

## balances largely denominated in Swiss franc, other major European currencies, and the Chinese renminbi with its foreign businesses. In

## accordance with U.S. GAAP, these contracts are considered “derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.” Gains or losses on these

## instruments are reported in current earnings. The foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance

## sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023, as disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized in other

## charges (income), net a net gain of $2.0 million and net losses of $19.7 million and $21.6 million during the years ended December 31,

## 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which offset the related net transaction gains (losses) associated with these contracts. At

## December 31, 2024 and 2023, these contracts had a notional value of $788.6 million and $793.9 million, respectively.

## The Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial

## instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and financial

## institutions with high credit ratings. The Company believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under

## these contracts.

## 7. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

## At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had derivative assets totaling $9.2 million and $8.3 million, respectively, and

## derivative liabilities totaling $8.5 million and $25.2 million, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial

## instruments and therefore does not present all the required disclosures in tabular format. The fair values of the interest rate swap

## agreements, the cross currency swap agreements, and the foreign currency forward contracts that economically hedge short-term

## intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and priced with

## observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated the valuation

## methodologies used to develop the fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price

## in the Company’s principal market. In addition, the Company uses an internally developed model to perform testing on the valuations

## received from brokers. The Company has also considered both its own credit risk and counterparty credit risk in determining fair value

## and determined these adjustments were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

## Under U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly

## transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement consists of observable and unobservable

## inputs that reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.

## A fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes these inputs into three levels:

## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

## Level 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities

## Level 3: Unobservable inputs

## Credit Agreement

## On May 30, 2024, the Company entered into a $1.35 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended its $1.25 billion

## Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement). As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $615.3 million of

## additional borrowings available under its Credit Agreement.

## The Credit Agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions (similar to the Company's Prior Credit Agreement) and has a

## maturity date of May 30, 2029. It is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity.

## The obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.

## Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s consolidated

## leverage ratio. The Company must also pay facility fees that are tied to its leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that

## are similar to those contained in the Prior Credit Agreement, with which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2024. The

## Company is required to maintain (i) a ratio of net funded indebtedness to EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0 or less except in certain circumstances

## and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 or greater. The Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the Company, including

## limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has several events of default,

## with customary grace periods as applicable. The Company incurred approximately $0.2 million of debt extinguishment costs during 2024

## related to the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company capitalized $2.0 million in financing fees during 2024 associated with the Credit

## Agreement, which will be amortized to interest expense through 2029.

## Other Local Arrangements

## In April 2018, two of the Company’s non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly

## owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of SARON plus 87.5

## basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2024.

## 1 1. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

## Common Stock

## The number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock is 125,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.01 per share.

## Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to one vote per share. At December 31, 2024, 3,387,431 shares of the Company’s

## Share Repurchase Program

## In November 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.5 billion to the share repurchase program, which

## had $1.7 billion of remaining availability as of December 31, 2024. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated

## from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount

## and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition

## activity, and other factors.

## The Company has purchased 32.4 million of common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through December 31,

## 2024, at a total cost of $9.8 billion. The Company spent $850.0 million, $900 million, and $1.1 billion during 2024, 2023, and 2022,

## respectively, on the repurchase of 645,139 shares, 691,913 shares, and 838,010 shares at an average price per share of $1,317.52,

## $1,300.72, and $1,312.61, respectively. The Company reissued 68,428 shares, 79,076 shares, and 133,916 shares held in treasury for the

## exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In addition, we incurred $7.8 million and

## $8.1 million of excise tax during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the Inflation Reduction Act, which

## is reflected as a reduction in shareholders' equity in our consolidated financial statements.

## 12. EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN

## The Company’s equity incentive plan provides employees and directors of the Company additional incentives to join and/or remain

## in the service of the Company as well as to maintain and enhance the long-term performance and profitability of the Company. The

## Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders on May 2, 2013 and provides that 2 million shares of common

## stock, plus any shares that remained available for grant under the Company’s prior equity incentive plan as well as options outstanding

## that terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards. The plan provides for the grant of options, restricted stock units,

## and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on

## the date of the award. Options primarily vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and have a maximum term of up to 10

## years. Restricted units primarily vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant. Performance share units generally vest after a

## three-year period from the date of the grant based upon satisfaction of the performance condition. The compensation committee of the

## Board of Directors has generally granted restricted share units to participating managers and non-qualified stock options and performance

## share units to executive officers.

## On May 6, 2021, the Company's shareholders approved the adoption of the Company's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended and

## Restated), with the effect that approximately 0.9 million additional shares of common stock were added to the 2.1 million shares that

## remained available under the plan prior to its amendment. In addition, shares subject to options granted under the Company's prior equity

## incentive plan that terminate or are forfeited without being exercised are also available for awards under the amended plan. The amended

## plan expires in 2031.

## service in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation expense is recorded within selling, general, and administrative in the

## consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.

## The fair values of stock options granted were calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The aggregate intrinsic value of an

## option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds its exercise price. The following table summarizes all stock

## 2023, and 2022 was $494.81, $400.30, and $447.52, respectively.

## Such weighted average grant-date fair value was determined using the following assumptions:

## million, $68.7 million, and $121.3 million, respectively.

## In November 2023, the Company also granted 7,137 performance options with a grant-date fair value of $2.9 million upon

## Company’s cumulative average local currency sales growth rate over the four-year period ending December 31, 2027. If the performance

## target is met, the performance options cliff vest at the conclusion of the four-year period and will settle based upon actual performance

## ranging from zero to 150% of the target. Compensation expense is recognized over the four-year period based on the estimated actual

## The weighted average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022 was

## $1,260.96, $1,029.48, and $1,230.18 per unit, respectively, which primarily vest ratably over a five-year period. The total fair value of the

## restricted stock units on the date of grant was $12.2 million for 2024, $12.8 million for 2023, and $10.8 million for 2022 and will be

## recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested

## during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was approximately $8.7 million, $8.6 million, and $8.2 million, respectively.

## Approximately $8.3 million, $8.8 million, and $7.9 million of compensation expense was recognized during the years ended

## December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

## The Company granted performance share units with a market condition during 2024, 2023, and 2022. Grantees of performance share

## units will be eligible to receive shares of the Company’s common stock depending upon the Company’s total shareholder return relative

## to the performance of companies in the S&P 500 Health Care and S&P 500 Industrials over a three-year period. The awards actually

## earned will range from zero to 200% of the targeted number of performance share units for the three-year performance period and will be

## The projected post-retirement benefit obligation was principally determined using discount rates of 5.02% in 2024 and 4.49% in

## 2023. Net periodic post-retirement benefit cost was principally determined using discount rates of 4.49% in 2024, 4.67% in 2023, and

## 1.94% in 2022.

## The Company’s overall asset investment strategy is to achieve long-term growth while minimizing volatility by widely diversifying

## among asset types and strategies. Target asset allocations and investment return criteria are established by the pension committee or

## designated officers of each plan. Target asset allocation ranges for the U.S. pension plan include 40-60% in equity securities, 23-33% in

## fixed income securities, and 15-25% in other types of investments. International plan assets relate primarily to the Company’s Swiss

## pension plan with target allocations of 24-45% in equities, 35-55% in fixed income securities, and 15-25% in other types of investments.

## Actual results are monitored against targets and the trustees are required to report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of

## investment performance on an annual basis at a minimum. Day-to-day asset management is typically performed by third-party asset

## managers, reporting to the pension committees or designated officers.

## The long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP is generally based on

## estimated future returns for the target investment mix determined by the trustees as well as historical investment performance.

## A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

```
2024 2023
Unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year $ 58,225 $ 50,822
Increases related to current tax positions 10,399 5,867
Decreases related to prior year tax positions (1,169) (2,641)

Impact of foreign currency (2,040) 4,177
Unrecognized tax benefits at end of year $ 45,435 $ 58,225
```
## Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $45.4 million and $58.2 million,

## respectively, of tax benefits that if recognized would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate. During year ended December 31, 2024, the

## Company's unrecognized tax benefits were reduced by $20.0 million plus accrued interest of $3.0 million pertaining to the settlement of a

## tax audit. Other increases and decreases related to current and prior year tax positions during 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to non-

## United States income taxes. The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as

## part of its income tax expense within its consolidated statement of operations. The amount of accrued interest and penalties included

## within other non-current liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $9.4 million

## and $10.9 million, respectively.

## The Company plans to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in

## future years and believes that there will be no additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other than non-

## U.S. withholding taxes, certain state taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any, for which a deferred tax liability has been recognized.

## All other undistributed earnings and any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities and the contributed capital of our

## foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested on which no U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes

## have been provided. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings and

## additional outside basis differences in these entities due to the complexity of the calculation and the uncertainty regarding assumptions

## necessary to compute the tax.

## As of December 31, 2024, the major jurisdictions for which the Company is subject to examinations are: Germany for years after

## 2018, the United States after 2016, France after 2021, Switzerland after 2021, the United Kingdom after 2020, and China after 2020.

## Additionally, the Company is currently under examination in various taxing jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While

## the Company has not yet received any material assessments from these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate amounts

## of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these examinations and that the

## ultimate outcome of these examinations will not result in a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or

## financial position.

## Legal

## The Company is party to various legal proceedings, including certain environmental matters, incidental to the normal course of

## business. Management does not expect that any of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial

## condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

## 18. SEGMENT REPORTING

## The Company has five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations,

## and Other Operations. U.S. Operations represent certain of the Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in the United

## States. Western European Operations include the Company’s marketing and producing organizations in Western Europe, excluding

## operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations include marketing and producing organizations located in Switzerland as well as

## extensive R&D operations that are responsible for the development, production, and marketing of precision instruments, including

## weighing, analytical, and measurement technologies for use in a variety of laboratory and industrial applications. Chinese Operations

## represent the Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in China. The Company’s market organizations are

## geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of the Company’s sales and service. Operations that exist outside these

## reportable segments are included in Other Operations.

## The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies.

## Our reportable segments comprise the structure used by our Chief Executive Officer, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker

## (CODM), to make key operating decisions and assess performance. The Company evaluates performance based on segment profit for

## segment reporting (gross profit less research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, before amortization,

## interest expense, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net, and taxes). Inter-segment sales and transfers are priced to reflect

## consideration of market conditions and the regulations of the countries in which the transferring entities are located.

### DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT’S SECURITIES

### REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

_As of December 31, 2024, Mettler Toledo International Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our") had one class of securities registered under Section 12
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: our common stock._

**DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK**
_The following summary of the terms of our capital stock is based upon our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Second Amended
and Restated By-laws. The summary is not complete, and is qualified by reference to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended
and Restated By-laws, which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated by reference herein._

**Authorized Capital Stock**

We are authorized to issue up to 135,000,000 shares of capital stock, all with a par value of one cent ($.01) per share, of which 125,000,000 shares are
designated as common stock, and 10,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock. As of December 31, 2024, 20,949,461 shares of our common stock were
issued outstanding, 23,259,839 shares of our common stock were held in treasury, and no shares of our preferred stock were outstanding.

Common Stock

_Voting Rights_

The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by our stockholders. Our stockholders do not have
cumulative voting rights.

Our Second Amended and Restated By-laws provide that stockholders representing a majority in number of the total outstanding shares of capital stock
entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum of the stockholders for all purposes.

_Dividends and Other Distribution; Liquidation Rights_

Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any series of preferred stock outstanding from time to time, the holders of our common stock are entitled to
receive ratably any dividends, as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for that purpose.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining
after payment of liabilities, subject to prior distribution rights of our preferred stock, if any, then outstanding.

_Fully Paid and Nonassessable_

```
The outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and nonassessable.
```
_No Preemptive, Conversion or Subscription Rights; No Redemption or Sinking Fund Provisions_

Holders of our common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights, and there are no sinking fund or redemption provisions relating to any shares of our
common stock. In addition, holders of our common stock do not have any subscription or other similar rights to purchase additional shares of any class of our capital
stock.

_Amendments_

Our Second Amended and Restated By-laws provide that the By-laws and any amendment thereof may be altered, amended or repealed, or new By-laws
may be adopted by the Board of Directors at any regular or special meeting of the Board. In the case of any special meeting at which all of the members of the Board
are not present, the notice of such meeting shall have stated that the amendment of the By-laws was one of the purposes of the meeting.

The Second Amended and Restated By-laws and any amendment thereof, including the By-laws adopted by the Board of Directors, may be altered,
amended or repealed and other By-laws may be adopted by the holders of a majority of the total outstanding stock of the corporation entitled to vote at any annual
meeting or at any special meeting, provided, in the case of any special meeting, that notice of such proposed alteration, amendment, repeal or adoption is included in
the notice of the meeting.

_Removal and Vacancies_

```
Members of the Board of Directors may be removed with or without cause at a special meeting of the stockholders
```

```
Exhibit 4.4
```
called for the purpose of removing the Director.

Whenever any Director shall have been elected by the holders of any class of stock of the corporation voting separately as a class under the provisions of the
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, such director may be removed, and the vacancy filled only by the holders of that class of stock voting separately
as a class.

Vacancies caused by any such removal and not filled by the stockholders at the meeting at which such removal shall have been made, or any vacancy caused
by the death or resignation of any Director or for any other reason, and any newly created directorship resulting from any increase in the authorized number of
Directors, may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors then in office, although less than a quorum, and any Director so elected to fill any such
vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.

When one or more Directors shall resign effective at a future date, a majority of Directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have
power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each Director so chosen
shall hold office as provided in the Second Amended and Restated By-laws in connection with the filling of other vacancies.

_Additional Shares of Common Stock_

We may issue additional authorized shares of our common stock as authorized by our Board of Directors from time to time by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the shares of common stock then outstanding.

_Stock Exchange Listing_

```
Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “MTD.”
```
_Transfer Agent and Registrar_

```
Computershare Trust Company N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.
```
Preferred Stock

As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no shares of preferred stock of any series or class is outstanding.
Our Board of Directors, without further shareholder authorization, is authorized to approve the issuance, from time to time, of shares of our preferred stock
in one or more series, to establish the number of shares to be included in any such series, and to fix the rights, preferences over dividends on the common stock and
one or more other series of the preferred stock, conversion rights, voting rights (in addition to those provided by law), redemption rights and the terms of any sinking
fund therefore, and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up, including preferences over the common stock and one or more other series of the preferred
stock.

The issuance of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in
control of the Company or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.

Anti-takeover Effects of Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and Delaware Law

Some provisions of Delaware law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Second Amended and Restated By-laws could make the
following more difficult: (i) acquisition of the Company by means of a tender offer, (ii) acquisition of the Company by means of a proxy contest or otherwise, or (iii)
removal of the Company’s incumbent officers and directors.

```
These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids.
```
_Size of Board and Vacancies_

The Second Amended and Restated By-laws provide that the numbers of members of our Board of Directors will be determined by resolution of the Board.
Any director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, upon the affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock.
Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the Company’s authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board resulting from death or
resignation or any other cause may be filled by the majority vote of the Company’s remaining directors in office, even if less than a quorum, and any Director so
elected to fill any such vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold office until his successor is elected and qualified or until his earlier resignation or removal.

When one or more Directors resigns effective at a future date, a majority of Directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, have power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or


```
Exhibit 4.4
```
resignations become effective, and each Director so chosen shall hold office as herein provided in connection with the filling of other vacancies.

_Elimination of Stockholder Action by Written Consent_

The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation eliminates the right of the Company’s stockholders to act by written consent. Stockholder action
must take place at the annual or a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders.

_Stockholder Meetings_

Under the Second Amended and Restated By-laws, except as noted in the following sentence, only the Company’s chairman, president, and the Board may
call special meetings of the Company’s stockholders. Stockholders who in the aggregate beneficially own at least 50% of the voting power of all outstanding shares
of common stock of the Company may call a special meeting of the Company’s stockholders through the Secretary upon proper written request to the Secretary.

_Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals_

The Second Amended and Restated By-laws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and nomination of candidates for
election as directors other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee of the Board.

_Delaware Anti-takeover Law_

The Company is subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“Section 203”), an anti-takeover law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a
publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such person
became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination or the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder is approved in a
prescribed manner. Generally, a “business combination” includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested
stockholder. Generally, an “interested stockholder” is a person that, together with affiliates and associates, owns, or within three years prior to the determination of
interested stockholder status did own, 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to
transactions not approved in advance by the Board, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of Common
Stock.

_No Cumulative Voting_

Neither the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation nor the Second Amended and Restated By-laws provide for cumulative voting in the election
of directors.

_Undesignated Preferred Stock_

The authorization of the Company’s undesignated Preferred Stock makes it possible for the Board to issue Preferred Stock with voting or other rights or
preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the Company.

Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Second Amended and Restated By-laws, the Corporation shall indemnify to the full
extent authorized by law any person made or threatened to be made a party to an action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal, civil, administrative or investigative,
by reason of the fact that he, his testator or intestate is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or is or was serving, at the request of the
Corporation, as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise.

Exclusive Jurisdiction of Certain Actions

Our Second Amended and Restated By-laws require, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in the name of the Company,
actions against directors, officers, employees and stockholders for breach of fiduciary duty, any actions against the Company or any Director or Officer or employee
arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or the Second Amended and
Restated By-laws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, may be brought only in a state court located in the State of Delaware (or,
if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). Although we believe this provision
benefits the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the
effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company’s directors and officers.

Exhibit 10.23

## Mettler-Toledo International Inc.

## 2013 Equity Incentive Plan

## (Amended and Restated Effective as of May 6, 2021)

### STOCK UNIT MASTER AGREEMENT

## THIS MASTER AGREEMENT, made as of [...] , between Mettler-Toledo International Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), and the employee listed

below (the “Grantee”).

WHEREAS, the Company has adopted the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated Effective as of May 6, 2021 (the “Plan”) in order to provide
additional incentive to certain employees and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and the Committee has determined it may grant to the Grantee an Award
of Stock Units as provided herein to encourage the Grantee’s efforts toward the continuing success of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

## 1. Grant of Stock Units. From time to time, the Company may grant to the Grantee one or more awards of Stock Units (the “Awards”). Each individual grant

will be described in a grant notice (the "Grant Notice"), which will specify the respective date of grant and number of Shares subject to the Award, as well as any
terms relating to the Award that differ from this Master Agreement. The form of Grant Notice will be as specified by the Company from time to time, and may be
delivered in paper or electronic form. The Grantee may or may not be required to acknowledge a Grant Notice in the Company's discretion.

This Master Agreement shall be construed in accordance and consistent with, and subject to, the provisions of the Plan (the provisions of which are hereby
incorporated by reference) and, except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, the capitalized terms used in this Master Agreement shall have the same definitions as
set forth in the Plan.

## 2. No Ownership of Shares Until Vesting. At all times until Shares are actually transferred upon vesting in the manner provided in Sections 3 or 5 hereof or

any Grant Notice, the Award remains an unfunded, unsecured promise to deliver shares in the future. Ownership of the Shares relating to Stock Units will not pass to
Grantee until such vesting.

## 3. Vesting Generally. Except as provided in Sections 4 and 5 hereof or any individual Grant Notice, 20% of the number of Shares relating to Stock Units

## 4. Effect of Termination of Employment. If the Grantee’s employment ends for any reason, including as a result of the Grantee’s death, retirement or

Disability, or if the Grantee is terminated with or without Cause, all Shares relating to Stock Units which have not become vested shall be forfeited and shall revert to
the Company as of the date of such termination.

## 5. Effect of Change in Control. If your employment is terminated without Cause or if you resign for "Good Reason", in each case within 24 months following a

Change in Control, all Shares relating to Stock Units outstanding on the date of such Change in Control shall vest, and ownership of such Shares shall pass to

## 8. No Right to Continued Employment. Nothing in this Master Agreement, the Plan or any Grant Notice shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of

the Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate the Grantee’s employment, nor confer upon the Grantee any right to continuance of employment by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or continuance of service as a board member.

## 9. Withholding of Taxes. Prior to the delivery to the Grantee (or the Grantee’s estate, if applicable) of a stock certificate or evidence of book-entry Shares for

Shares relating to Stock Units that have vested, the Grantee shall pay to the Company the federal, state and local income taxes and other amounts as may be required
by law to be withheld by the Company (the “Withholding Taxes”) with respect to such Shares. By executing and returning this Master Agreement, the Grantee shall
be deemed to elect to have the Company withhold a portion of such Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to the Withholding Taxes in satisfaction of
the Withholding Taxes, such election to continue in effect until the Grantee notifies the Company before such delivery that the Grantee shall satisfy such obligation in
cash, in which event the Company shall not withhold a portion of such Shares as otherwise provided in this Section 9.

## 10. Grantee Bound by the Plan. The Grantee hereby acknowledges receipt of a copy of the Plan and agrees to be bound by all the terms and provisions thereof.

Grantee also acknowledges receipt of the plan materials, as prepared by the Company and as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, and expressly

competes with any business of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

## 12. Modification of Master Agreement; Severability. This Master Agreement may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated, and any terms or

conditions may be waived, but only by a written instrument executed by the parties hereto. Should any provision of this Master Agreement be held by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Master Agreement shall not be affected by such holding and
shall continue in full force in accordance with their terms.

## 13. Successors in Interest; Non-Transferability. This Master Agreement and any Grant Notice shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon any successor

to the Company and the Grantee’s legal representatives in the event of Grantee’s death. All obligations imposed upon the Grantee and all rights granted to the
Company under this Master Agreement and any Grant Notice shall be binding upon the Grantee’s heirs, executors, administrators and successors. No rights under
any Stock Unit Award may be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, nor may they be pledged or otherwise hypothecated.

## 14. Governing Law; Dispute Resolution. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Master Agreement and any Grant Notice shall be

governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to the conflicts of laws principles thereof. Any dispute or disagreement which may arise under,
or as a result of, or in any way relate to, the interpretation, construction or application of this Master Agreement or any Grant Notice shall be determined by the
Committee. Any determination made hereunder shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Grantee, the Grantee’s heirs, executors, administrators and successors,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries for all purposes.

## 15. Entire Agreement. This Master Agreement, the terms and conditions of the Plan, and any Grant Notice constitute the entire understanding between the

Grantee and the Company and its Subsidiaries, and supersede all other agreements, whether written or oral, with respect to any Award.

## 16. Counterparts. This Master Agreement may be executed simultaneously in two or more counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which

taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

## Insider Trading Policy

## 1. Introduction

METTLER TOLEDO is subject to US securities laws, which prohibit trading in securities on the basis of non-public, material information
and passing on such information to anyone else. Violations of insider trading laws carry severe monetary and criminal penalties and may

result in discipline up to and including separation from the company.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This policy seeks to limit insider trading risk and reinforces our commitment to properly handling confidential information. This policy

applies to all METTLER TOLEDO employees. Directors, Officers, and certain Designated Employees are subject to additional
requirements set forth in Guideline MT Insider Trading Policy for Directors, Officers, and Designated Employees. It is important to note
that insider trading laws also apply to anyone with material, non-public information about the company, such as contractors, consultants,
or persons living in your household.

## 3. Prohibition of Insider Trading and Tipping

All employees must abide by the following rules:

- If you have material, non-public information relating to METTLER TOLEDO you may not buy or sell company securities, change

```
earlier instructions to buy or sell company securities, or engage in any other action to take advantage of that information. Company
securities include shares, options, any other derivative instrument, and certain investments in company-sponsored retirement plans
(for example the METTLER TOLEDO Stock Fund investment option in the U.S. 401(k) plan).
```
- You may not trade the securities of any other company, including customers, suppliers, competitors, and potential acquisition targets
    on the basis of material, non-public information that you obtained in the course of your work at METTLER TOLEDO.
- You may not pass on to others any material, non-public information about METTLER
    TOLEDO or other companies obtained in the course of your work (referred to as
    "tipping"). You can be held liable for another person’s violation of insider trading laws
    even if you do not benefit financially from that person's actions.
- Except with the prior written approval of both the relevant General Manager and
    General Counsel, you may not consult for or otherwise participate in professional,
    industry or other networks that provide information, data, or other consulting services
    for investment professionals (known as “expert networks”).
- You must ensure compliance with this policy by all persons living in your household,

```
and all entities and persons subject to your influence or control (for example corporations, partnerships, trusts, and family members
that don't share your household but consult with you before they trade). You will be held responsible for any violations by them.
```
- Your transactions will be evaluated with the benefit of hindsight. Before engaging in a
    transaction, you should consider how others may interpret it after the fact.


```
Exhibit 19.1

## 4. What is Material Information

Material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making a decision to buy, hold, or sell
securities. Examples of information that is typically considered material include (whether negative or positive) earnings or sales
information, changes in senior management, development of a significant new product, process or service, news of a pending or
proposed merger or acquisition, or a significant cybersecurity incident. This list of examples is not comprehensive: materiality is judged
considering all facts and circumstances at a given moment, so any information could potentially be material. Material information may be
something that is quantitatively material, qualitatively material, or both. If you are not sure whether information is considered material,
please consult with the General Counsel.

## 5. When is Information Public

The above prohibitions apply until information is public. “Non-public” information is information that has not been previously disclosed to

the general public and is otherwise not available to the general public. As a general rule, you may consider information public on the
second business day after it has been publicly distributed. An example of such public distribution would be a company press release

containing the information: if the company issues a press release after the close of trading on Thursday, the information in the press
release could be considered public at the open of business on the following Monday. As with questions of materiality, if you are not sure

whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the General Counsel or assume that the information is non-
public and treat it as confidential.

## 6. Who to Contact if You have Questions

You should contact the General Counsel or the Compliance Director if you have questions about the applicability of this Guideline to any
planned transactions.

METTLER TOLEDO

## Insider Trading Policy for Directors, Officers, and Designated Employees

## 1. Introduction

METTLER TOLEDO is subject to US securities laws, which prohibit trading in securities on the basis of non-public, material information
and passing on such information to anyone else. Violations of insider trading laws carry severe monetary and criminal penalties and may
result in discipline up to and including separation from the company.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

This policy seeks to limit insider trading risk and reinforces our commitment to properly handling confidential information. This policy
applies to all METTLER TOLEDO employees. Directors, Officers, and certain Designated Employees are subject to additional
requirements set forth in Guideline MT Insider Trading Policy for Directors, Officers, and Designated Employees. It is important to note

that insider trading laws also apply to anyone with material, non-public information about the company, such as contractors, consultants,
or persons living in your household.

## 3. Prohibition of Insider Trading and Tipping

All employees must abide by the following rules:

- If you have material, non-public information relating to METTLER TOLEDO you may not buy or sell company securities, change
    earlier instructions to buy or sell company securities, or engage in any other action to take advantage of that information. Company
    securities include shares, options, any other derivative instrument, and certain investments in company-sponsored retirement plans
    (for example the METTLER TOLEDO Stock Fund investment option in the U.S. 401(k) plan).
- You may not trade the securities of any other company, including customers, suppliers, competitors, and potential acquisition targets

```
on the basis of material, non-public information that you obtained in the course of your work at METTLER TOLEDO.
```
- You may not pass on to others any material, non-public information about METTLER

```
TOLEDO or other companies obtained in the course of your work (referred to as
"tipping"). You can be held liable for another person’s violation of insider trading laws
even if you do not benefit financially from that person's actions.
```
- Except with the prior written approval of both the relevant General Manager and
    General Counsel, you may not consult for or otherwise participate in professional,
    industry or other networks that provide information, data, or other consulting services
    for investment professionals (known as “expert networks”).
- You must ensure compliance with this policy by all persons living in your household,

```
and all entities and persons subject to your influence or control (for example corporations, partnerships, trusts, and family members
that don't share your household but consult with you before they trade). You will be held responsible for any violations by them.
```
- Your transactions will be evaluated with the benefit of hindsight. Before engaging in a
    transaction, you should consider how others may interpret it after the fact.

## 4. What is Material Information

Material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in making a decision to buy, hold, or sell

securities. Examples of information that is typically considered material include (whether negative or positive) earnings or sales
information, changes in senior management, development of a significant new product, process or service, news of a pending or

proposed merger or acquisition, or a significant cybersecurity incident. This list of examples is not comprehensive: materiality is judged
considering all facts and circumstances at a given moment, so any information could potentially be material. Material information may be
something that is quantitatively material, qualitatively material, or both. If you are not sure whether information is considered material,
please consult with the General Counsel.

## 5. When is Information Public

The above prohibitions apply until information is public. “Non-public” information is information that has not been previously disclosed to
the general public and is otherwise not available to the general public. As a general rule, you may consider information public on the
second business day after it has been publicly distributed. An example of such public distribution would be a company press release
containing the information: if the company issues a press release after the close of trading on Thursday, the information in the press
release could be considered public at the open of business on the following Monday. As with questions of materiality, if you are not sure
whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the General Counsel or assume that the information is non-

public and treat it as confidential.

## 6. Trading is Only Permitted in Window Periods

Persons subject to this guideline may only buy, sell, change earlier instructions to buy or sell,
or otherwise conduct transactions in company securities during "window periods" which start
on the second business day after the release of our earnings information each quarter and
end on the fifth calendar day of the last month of each quarter. Note that activity inside a
window period does not absolve you of responsibility under the insider trading laws. You
may not act, even within a window period, if you are in possession of material non-public
information.

In its discretion, the Company may change window periods or determine additional periods

where trading is prohibited.

## 7. Prohibition of Hedging and Pledging Transactions

Directors and executive officers of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. are prohibited from
hedging the ownership of company securities, including trading in publicly-traded options,
puts, calls, or other derivative instruments that are directly related to company securities,
and also are generally restricted from transactions pledging ownership of company
securities.

## 8. Pre-Approval and Notice Requirements

Directors and executive officers of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. must obtain prior approval of all transactions in company securities
from the General Counsel or Compliance Director. All persons subject to this guideline must inform the CEO prior to any trade or trades

with an expected total value of $1 million or more in a quarter. This includes all purchases and sales of shares, exercises of options, or
other transfers in ownership of whatever nature (gifts, hedges, charitable contributions, etc.). Individuals should plan on a reasonable

time to obtain pre-clearance, generally at least one day prior to trading.


```
Exhibit 19.2
```
Any written plan, such as a Rule 10b5-1 plan, relating to the purchase or sale of company
securities must be approved in advance by the General Counsel. Purchases or sales
pursuant to an approved Rule 10b5-1 plan do not require additional approval.

Directors and executive officers must also give the General Counsel prompt notice of all
completed transactions, where possible on the trade date itself.

## 9. Compliance Committee

The Compliance Committee consists of the CEO, CFO, and General Counsel of Mettler-Toledo International Inc. The Compliance
Committee will determine those employees who are covered by this policy, with the assistance of the Head of HR. The Compliance
Committee may extend or shorten a window period or otherwise make exceptions to the trading restrictions. The Compliance Committee

will meet prior to the regularly scheduled opening of the window each quarter (which may take the form of a regularly scheduled
Disclosure Committee meeting) to confirm the window should be opened.
