**Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition**

The following information is furnished pursuant to Item 2.02, “Results of Operations and Financial Condition.” The information
furnished in this Form 8-K and the Exhibit attached hereto shall not be treated as filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, except as shall be expressly set
forth by specific reference in such filing.

On November 6, 2025 Mettler-Toledo International Inc. ("Mettler-Toledo") issued a press release (the Release) setting forth its

financial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. A copy of the Release is furnished hereto as Exhibit 99.
to this report.

**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**

Mettler-Toledo supplements its U.S. GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. The principal non-GAAP financial
measures Mettler-Toledo uses are Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local
Currency Sales Growth.

_Adjusted Earnings per Share_

Mettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Earnings per Share as diluted earnings per common share excluding certain non-recurring
discrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangible assets, net of tax, restructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time
charges, net of tax. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is diluted earnings per common share.

Mettler-Toledo believes that Adjusted Earnings per Share is important supplemental information for investors. Mettler-Toledo
uses this measure because it excludes certain non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangibles, net of tax,
restructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time charges, net of tax, which management believes are not directly related to
current and ongoing operations thereby providing investors with information that helps to compare ongoing operating performance.

Adjusted Earnings per Share is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Adjusted Earnings per Share is not intended to represent diluted earnings per common share under U.S. GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to diluted earnings per common share as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the
following limitations.

_Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings per Share_

Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings per Share, has certain material limitations as follows:

It does not include certain non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization expense of purchased intangibles, net of tax,
restructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time charges, net of tax. Because non-recurring discrete tax items,

amortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and certain other one-time charges are components of diluted earnings
per share under U.S. GAAP, any measure that excludes non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangibles,
restructuring charges and certain other one-time charges, has material limitations.

```

```

_Adjusted Operating Profit_

Mettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Operating Profit as gross profit less research and development and selling, general and
administrative expenses before amortization, interest, restructuring charges and other charges (income), net and taxes. The most
directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is earnings before taxes.

Mettler-Toledo believes that Adjusted Operating Profit is important supplemental information for investors. Adjusted Operating
Profit is used internally as the principal profit measurement by its segments in their reporting to management. Mettler-Toledo uses
this measure because it excludes amortization, interest, restructuring charges and other charges (income), net and taxes, which are

not allocated to the segments.

On a consolidated basis, Mettler-Toledo also believes Adjusted Operating Profit is an important supplemental method of

measuring profitability. It is used internally by senior management for measuring profitability and setting performance targets for
managers, and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results. Mettler-
Toledo also believes that Adjusted Operating Profit is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of
comparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest
rates and effective tax rates, and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to

intangible assets.

Adjusted Operating Profit is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Adjusted Operating Profit is not intended to represent operating income under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an
alternative to earnings before taxes as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the following limitations.

_Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Profit_

Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Profit, has certain material limitations as follows:

**-** It excludes amortization expense. Because this item is recurring, any measure that excludes amortization expense has
    material limitations.
**-** It does not include interest expense. Because Mettler-Toledo has borrowed money to finance some of its operations, interest
    is a necessary and ongoing part of its costs and has assisted Mettler-Toledo in generating revenue. Therefore any measure
    that excludes interest expense has material limitations.
**-** It excludes restructuring charges. Because restructuring charges are a component of operating income under U.S. GAAP,
    any measure that excludes restructuring charges, has material limitations.
**-** It excludes other charges (income), net. Because other charges (income), net is a component of operating income under U.S.
    GAAP, any measure that excludes other charges (income), net, has material limitations.

_Adjusted Free Cash Flow_

Mettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities including proceeds from the sale of
property, plant and equipment, less capital expenditures, and before restructuring, acquisition cost payments, and tax reform
payments. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities

```
3
```

Mettler-Toledo believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow is important supplemental information for investors. It is used internally by
senior management for measuring operating cash flow generation and setting performance targets for managers, and has historically

been used as one of the means of providing guidance on possible future cash flows.

Adjusted Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted
Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent net cash provided by operating activities recorded under U.S. GAAP and should not be
considered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of
the following limitations.

_Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow_

Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, has certain material limitations as follows:

**-** It includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and purchases of property, plant and equipment, which
    are not considered to be components of net cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP. Therefore any measure
    that includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and purchases of property, plant and equipment has
    material limitations.
**-** It excludes restructuring, acquisition cost payments, and tax reform payments which is considered to be a component of net
    cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP. Therefore any measure that excludes these items has material
    limitations.

_Local Currency Sales Growth_

Mettler-Toledo defines Local Currency Sales Growth as sales growth excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations
that result from translating activity outside of the United States into U.S. dollars. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial
measure is U.S. dollar sales growth.

Mettler-Toledo believes that Local Currency Sales Growth is important supplemental information for investors. Mettler-Toledo
believes local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between
periods.

Local Currency Sales Growth is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Local Currency Sales Growth is not intended to represent U.S. dollar sales growth under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered
as an alternative to U.S. dollar sales growth as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the following limitations.

_Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Local Currency Sales Growth_

Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Local Currency Sales Growth, has certain material limitations as follows:

It does not include the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations that result from translating activity outside of the United
States into U.S. dollars. Because the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is a component of sales growth under U.S.
GAAP, any measure that excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, has material limitations.

Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local Currency Sales Growth should not
be relied upon to the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures, but reflect additional measures of comparability and means of
viewing aspects of Mettler-Toledo’s operations that, when viewed together with its U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying
reconciliations to net

```
4
```

earnings, net cash provided by operating activities and diluted earnings per share, provide a more complete understanding of factors
and trends affecting its business.

Because Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local Currency Sales Growth
are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or
similar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not
to rely on any single financial measure.

The Release provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow
to the most comparable financial measures recorded under U.S. GAAP. The Release also presents Local Currency Sales Growth in
conjunction with its most comparable financial measure recorded under U.S. GAAP.

### METTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC. REPORTS

### THIRD QUARTER 2025 RESULTS

COLUMBUS, Ohio, USA – November 6, 2025 – Mettler-Toledo International Inc. (NYSE: MTD) today announced third quarter
results for 2025. Provided below are the highlights:

- Reported sales increased 8% compared with the prior year. In local currency, sales increased 6% compared with the prior
    year.
- Net earnings per diluted share as reported (EPS) were $10.57, compared with $9.96 in the prior-year period. Adjusted EPS
    was $11.15, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $10.21. Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and a
    reconciliation to EPS is included on the last page of the attached schedules.

**Third Quarter Results**

Patrick Kaltenbach, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our third quarter results were strong and reflected very good
growth, especially in Industrial. I am very pleased with our team’s strong execution as we leverage our Spinnaker sales and
marketing program and innovative product portfolio to drive growth while delivering solid EPS.”

GAAP Results
EPS in the quarter was $10.57, compared with the prior-year amount of $9.96.

Compared with the prior year, total reported sales increased 8% to $1,029.7 million. By region, reported sales increased 10% in the
Americas, 13% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Earnings before taxes amounted to $269.2 million, compared with $259.
million in the prior year.

Non-GAAP Results
Adjusted EPS was $11.15, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $10.21.

Compared with the prior year, total sales in local currency increased 6%. By region, local currency sales increased 10% in the
Americas, 6% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to $309.9 million, compared with the
prior-year amount of $296.6 million.

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are
provided in the attached schedules.

**Nine Month Results**

GAAP Results
EPS was $28.12, compared with the prior-year amount of $28.55 which included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.07 per share.

Compared with the prior year, total reported sales increased 2% to $2.897 billion. By region, reported sales increased 4% in the
Americas, 3% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Earnings before taxes amounted to $719.8 million, compared with $722.

```
-1-
```

Total sales in local currency increased 2% compared with the prior year. By region, local currency sales as compared to prior year
increased 4% in the Americas, were flat in Europe, and increased 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Excluding the impact from delayed
fourth quarter 2023 shipments that benefited first quarter 2024 sales, year-to-date 2025 local currency sales increased 4%, including
5% growth in the Americas, 3% growth in Europe, and 2% growth in Asia/Rest of World. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to
$829.9 million, compared with the prior-year amount of $848.0 million.

Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are
provided in the attached schedules.

**Share Repurchase Authorization**

The Company noted its Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.75 billion to be added to the share repurchase program, which
had $1.1 billion remaining as of September 30, 2025. The Company expects the additional authorization will be utilized over the
next few years, and that the repurchases will be made through open-market transactions, and the amount and timing will depend on
business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.

**Outlook**
Management cautions that market conditions are uncertain and could change quickly. Based on today's assessment, management
anticipates local currency sales for the fourth quarter of 2025 will increase approximately 3%. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be $12.
to $12.88, a growth rate of 2% to 4%. Included in the fourth quarter guidance is an estimated 7% gross headwind to Adjusted EPS
growth due to higher tariff costs.

For the full year 2025, management anticipates local currency sales will increase approximately 2%, which includes a headwind of
approximately 1.5% from the previously disclosed shipping delays in the fourth quarter of 2023 that benefited the first quarter of

2024. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $42.05 to $42.25, representing growth of approximately 2% to 3%. This forecast
includes headwinds of approximately 4% from the previously mentioned shipping delays, and an additional 5% gross headwind
from higher tariff costs. This compares with previous local currency sales growth guidance of approximately 1% to 2% and Adjusted
EPS guidance of $41.70 to $42.20.

The Company stated that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth of
approximately 4% in 2026. This is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of $45.35 to $46.00, representing growth of
approximately 8% to 9%.

The Company does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with
reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the timing and amount of future restructuring and other non-recurring items.

**Conclusion**

Kaltenbach concluded, “Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities while benefiting from trends like
automation, digitalization, and onshoring. We continue to remain very agile as we face several uncertainties in global trade disputes
and governmental policies. We are confident that our strategic initiatives and strong culture of innovation and operational excellence
will enable us to continue delivering strong performance in this dynamic environment. The additional share repurchase authorization
also allows us to continue the share repurchase program that has provided strong returns for our shareholders over many years. We
are confident in our future growth prospects, and our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong.”
