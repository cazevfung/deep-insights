  "transcript": "how to start exercising when you're unfit how many of us hate exercise maybe hates too much of a strong word maybe we just don't enjoy it for some of us we've tried it and for others we'll said work towards tomorrow but you know what that is not you anymore you've made the decision to want to start exercising but you just don't know where to start here's what to do so in this video I want to help you create the right exercise program for your car levels of fitness and strength but more importantly I want to get into the overlooked factors that you should really know if you're serious about getting fit strong and healthy AF this topic is huge in itself most of my college degree was this but to sift through it all the most important factors that you need to know when you're starting to exercise when you're unfit is total weekly volume and exercise modality so what does that mean a lot of us with myself included focus on the individual workout itself it's so easy for us to become fixated on smashing those individual sessions which only makes us so and unable to use our legs next day to dispel the myth a soreness does not mean you've had a good work it just simply means you're not used to it and your body just trying to adapt there's actually a bunch of study that show this I'll leave it down in the description if you want to read for me so instead of smashing the individual session itself I always advocate to focus on the macro and let me just explain why when starting almost anything we go too fast too soon so let's put this into the perspective of exercise let's say cardio we set ourselves three days a week to run around the block we do it it feels good so the next week we double it Amy for two blocks a week every single session that's when it becomes very tough almost impossible for some of you it might be manageable but if we're coming from a place where we're not very fit we haven't run for maybe a couple months or years it's going to be really really tough and more importantly it's not sustainable the point I'm trying to make is you don't want to program something that's only manageable for a couple of weeks you want something that actually helps you be consistent for the ongoing habit of exercise and here's how we can make the right exercise program for you two would burn out or going too fast too soon you want to aim for steady improvements aiming to improve by up to 10% per week is actually very generous some of the top athletes strives so hard just to make one percent so what exactly is that five to ten percent I'm referring to your weekly each volume of exercise let's go back to the running example so let's just say that each block is a combination so by going three times week waiting three kilometres a 10% improvement for that week will be an extra 300 meters so if you split that up over the three days that's an extra hundred meters per session I really have that paid sense if it didn't then don't worry I'll be providing you a link down below which is a calculator to help you with this but the point is although it is a very small tweak it can lead to a huge improvement especially in the long term now if you're in the gym which is almost like everyone before we actually get into the car and make your way to the gym hit the subscribe button and who cuz I with a like when you are in the gym you want to be focusing on how much weight you're actually lifting in the gym with how many reps but just like the example of running you want to aim for about a 5 and percent improvement especially if you're starting out if you wanted more in-depth videos on exercise programming please let me know in the comments down below but let's talk about the second most important factor I can't tell you how many times I've tried a new exercise program with all these fancy exercises only having it to fizzle out and sort of dying I think it's because I just didn't like the exercises they're weird now because you're coming from a place where you're not so fit it's really important for you to find the exercises that you actually enjoy and this is what I mean by exercise if you hate skipping or maybe you're crap at it don't do it but something that's easy and something that you can't really say no to for me it's lifting weights it's easy it's methodical you literally pick things up and put things back down there are so many ways where you can prove your strength and fitness trying different things and experimenting can help big time the idea is don't be confined to what we think is traditional sighs or what's trending right now while works for someone else may not work for you so test play around or things finally works so those are the two actionable tips that you can implement straight away but here are the most important bits there's a reason why you're unfit and it's not just because of our lack of exercise it could be the fact that you're injured or maybe you just felt like you've never had the time maybe you're just lazy if you really want to create meaningful changes in your life and improve how fit or strong you are it's always a good idea to find out why you're unfit in the first place it's sort of like shoving things in that drawer that pretty much does everything we're telling ourselves that we're cleaning everything up but in reality we have an adjust the issue which is the unorganized mess you've changed the look of the workspace but the mess is still there and just waiting to be found now let's bring this to the context of exercise if we haven't addressed the main reason why won't fit chances are that whatever caused this will soon come back to politics this topic can be a whole video in itself but I actually have made a video that goes into some of this so I do recommend you to check it out if you have the time but some key questions that I like to ask my clients before actually starting exercise is why do you think your health is the way it is right now and when it comes down to being unfit to fit why is this change so important to you these are some deep questions but I want you to really have a think about it luckily I have included a section in that calculator for you to brainstorm and just drop things down I really recommend you to check it out another couple of things that I found to always be overlooked is actually outside of exercise itself the four overlooked factors that can impact your health and fitness are alcohol smoking diet and sleep these are all some common things that you should really be focusing on especially when starting to exercise alcohol is something that I personally see as unnecessary I'm not totally against it there are some studies that do support it in moderation but what the heck is moderation when you're drinking right ultimately if you truly think that alcohol isn't helping you with your fitness goals or maybe you feel like crap afterwards or even hungover then I do suggest cutting it out or at least limiting it smoking is a given it really messes up your lungs and to get rid of it now diet and sleep the two biggest factors in my opinion I've been guilty of this too but I think we all overcome okay what we need when we start exercising I think we've all seen that colleague who brings in their little containers with their bull chicken breast and bored vegetables and we automatically think they're on there like an exercise cleanse or some form of like new program that's been made what we eventually end up seeing is them giving you and saying screw it and having pad thai for much but I think the underlying issue with that is we often over restrict ourselves when it comes to new diets when starting exercise I think if we transition from a place of restriction into a place of abundance it can really help us start exercising and creating that habit I think if we focus on high quality unprocessed foods you can't really go wrong that way when showing that we give our body the right nutrients to get fit stronger and recover and more importantly we feel wholesome AF when we have a nice clean fresh meal now what about sleep there's nothing worse than tossing and turning your bed and realizing it's for 4:52 a.m. and having to get up at 6:00 we're irritable we get annoyed easily and our bodies actually aren't as strong and fit more specifically it's our time to exhaustion aka how long we can go for what's also interesting is that having a five to six hours sleep affected how our bodies break down and stores food making you more prone to prion weight aging how much sleep you get can dramatically improve your fitness levels and can make things a lot easier especially when you're starting a new exercise routine but as much as a quantity of sleep is important it's also about the quality of sleep we could be in bed for about 10 hours trade but if we're constantly getting up or maybe checking your friend in the overnight it's not high quality sleep I think if we start focusing on our quality of sleep as opposed to quantity it can really really help us as well so maybe before bear to start reading a book try not to go on your phone and maybe develop a nighttime routine or that is mentioned in my pate exercise in the morning shameless plug and they can all really there are so many things to talk about when it comes to starting to exercise when you're unfit so why do you want to start exercising let me know in the comments down below bye how to start exercising when you're unfit how many of us hate exercise maybe hates too much of a strong word maybe we just don't enjoy it for some of us we've tried it and for others we'll said work towards tomorrow but you know what that is not you anymore you've made the decision to want to start
