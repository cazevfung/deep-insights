  "transcript": "all right what's going on guys so in this video I'm going to lay out four steps for getting your gains back after a layoff so you can rebuild all the muscle and strength you lost as quickly as possible without setting yourself up for injury or overtraining and as I go through here I'm going to overlay some clips from my garage workouts this week I haven't personally gotten back to the gym and I'll probably be sticking to Garage workouts for another little while yet so I found that after a training break most people just don't want to hear the standard slow and steady advice you want to know how do I get my gains back quickly and I don't want it to take another year before I'm back to where I left off I think that's understandable and I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with thinking that way as long as you set up the comeback plan in a structured intelligent way so let's think about exactly how to do that well you don't want to waste any time so you'll want to Jack your volume all the way up to what you were doing before if you were doing 20 sets per week you'll want to just pick right back up there you're also going to want to train really hard right away too I guess shock your system into growth so you're going to want to take most sets all the way to failure so unfortunately this is the way most people probably will approach their training after a break but it's almost guaranteed to fail because it only considers one side of the muscle building equation it only considers the stimulus side without any consideration of recovery remember in order to build size and strength we need to present a stimulus in our case lifting weights to cause some amount of stress and then it's the recovery from that stress that induces a positive adaptation you get more jacked but the problem is when the stimulus gets too high too fast overwhelming your ability to recover to the point that you end up making slower gains despite doing more work and working harder so if we want to get our gains back as quickly as possible even though it may be tempting we can't just crank the stimulus side to the max we need to find a perfect balance of stimulus and recovery to maximize positive adaptation and as well see that's a trickier balance to strike after a training break because your ability to recover has taken a significant hit okay so let's lay out the four comeback principles first this is one of those rare times that you can't expect to grow like a new lifter again than taking steroids which I don't recommend the only other way to experience newbie gains twice is to stop lifting for a while and then start again this is because of the very powerful muscle memory effect that I talked about in my last video research repeatedly shows that it's much easier to rebuild lost muscle than it is to build new muscle from scratch so in this sense you might even consider yourself more supercharged than a newbie depending on just how much muscle you lost but I would say it actually starts before you even walk through the gym doors it's absolutely imperative that you have a structured comeback plan written down before you set foot in the gym if you want to get your gains back as fast as possible and that's because if you just freestyle it you will be very tempted to overdo it and as a result to throw off that delicate balance between stimulus and recovery so I decided to make a free four-week bridge program for you guys that covers all the come back principles in this video it's designed to get you from doing either no training or high rep bodyweight workouts back to standard progressive training in two to four weeks depending on how long your break was so you can use that as your plan or you can start with a blank sheet of paper and do up your own strategy based on these four principles okay the second comeback principle is that you need to expect to have lost some strength if you took more than two or three weeks off chances are you're gonna be a bit weaker than the more time you took off the more strength you'll have lost now because strength is a skill you can think of it like playing a sport so if you take months off shooting hoops chances are your stroke is going to look and feel a little off the first time you touch a ball again and the same thing goes for lifting heavy weights in the gym so you really need to check your ego and adjust your expectations to set wherever you are now as your new starting place forget your old numbers they do not matter anymore and start keeping a log of the weights you lift in those first few weeks and you'll quickly start seeing those numbers increase rapidly again now when it comes to strength regain as a general rule you can probably expect it to take about half the time you took off to get most of it back so if you took two months off it might take about one month to get your strength back assuming you do everything right if you took six months off you might need up to three months to build it back but good programming or genetic blessings can make that process even faster and the half the time rule only works for breaks on the scale of months years so the rule probably starts to break down if your layoff was longer than six months or so okay so after getting your expectations in check you need to choose what exercises you're going to focus on the main thing here is finding movements that won't get you too sore this is extremely important because soreness is the devil on a comeback program it doesn't do anything extra for hypertrophy and it just reduces your ability to perform and recover you're probably gonna get some watts or simply by just training again and that's okay but your goal should be to minimize it by prioritizing exercises that cause less muscle damage this means that exercises that load in a highly stretched position like walking lunges and Romanian deadlifts should be completely eliminated from the comeback program that's not because they're inherently more dangerous but simply because other exercises can stimulate the glutes and hamstrings equally well without the same recovery cost at a time when your recovery is already low so to borrow a term from dr. mike is or tell we want to prioritize exercises that have a high stimulus to fatigue ratio in other words focus on movements you can feel working the muscle well without also having you feel completely wrecked and sore for several days after and with a bit of forethought you can probably come up with a list of exercises that fit these criteria for you now this also means that cables and machines are your best friends right now because they tend to be lower impact and less damaging than their free weight counterparts now of course you still want to do a free weight exercises so don't shy away from doing squats deadlifts and presses just reintroduce they're loading more gradually and while compound movements pack a high stimulus they also pack a high fatigue so we need to be more careful with them at first as well now see in the fourth principle okay so after deciding the types of exercises we want to focus on we need to set up the retraining parameters to fit the comeback plan just right because we shouldn't just jump into whatever program we were doing before we need to build a bridge to get there and we can divide that bridge up into an intro phase lasting one or two weeks into transition phase also lasting one or two weeks so in total the bridge should take you two to four weeks where the longer the break you took from the gym the longer the bridge you'll need now let's start with the intro side the main goal here is to work on the neural aspect of lifting so you're mostly just reteaching your body in your brain to work together again this means that for compound exercises like squat deadlifts and presses you want to focus exclusively on mastering good technique through the use of very light loads when it comes to intensity we have two dials one for compound lifts and the other for isolation exercises for the compound lifts everything should be at an RPE of 5 or lower for the intro phase meaning you want to be leaving at least 5 reps in the tank so to give you something more tangible you want to be somewhere in the range of 50 to 60 percent of your old one rep max 4 sets with moderate reps so something around 4 to 6 reps so if your benchpress 1 rep max was 275 pounds before your two-month break you'll want to start your intro week with 50 to 60% of that so just 135 to 165 pounds for 2 sets of 5 now that may seem laughably light but remember you really don't need heavy loads to rebuild strength and size at all new lifters and by extension & D trained lifters don't need to go very close to failure to grow in fact a recent mass research review covered a study where a group training 7 to 8 reps shy of failure so at an RP of 2 or 3 still saw similar growth to a group going all the way to failure across eight weeks and while this approach certainly wouldn't be optimal for maximizing growth over the long term it does show that you will still make solid progress leaving upwards of 5 reps in the tank after your training break now keep in mind that pretty much all of your initial strength regain is going to come from your nervous system relearning the movement pattern so using very light weight is actually very helpful or as jumping right back into heavy weight could be actively harmful as your joints soft tissues and nervous system aren't accustomed to heavy loading yet now for the isolation exercises I think we can be a little more liberal and crank the RPE up to a 7 or an 8 but I still recommend avoiding failure instead you want to use isolation exercises strictly for establishing a strong mind muscle connection and getting acquainted with what it feels like to get a good pump again now when it comes to the volume dial I don't think we need to be quite as restrictive I personally think it's okay for most people to start with something around 7 to 10 sets per body part per week especially if you were doing bodyweight workouts or some other physical activity during your break now this is the exact volume range Schoenfeld and gergich gave in their 2017 paper outlining an intro phase for a one-year period ization scheme so there's no need to go ultra low on but I still don't recommend jumping right back to where your pre break volume was so if you're doing say three or four sets per exercise before you'd still want to knock that down to two or three sets now and then for frequency I think hitting each muscle twice per week is the sweet spot only turning the dial to once a week won't be enough to rebuild strength quickly because you won't be getting in enough lifting practice from motor learning and then frequencies higher than two or maybe three can also be an issue at first because you probably won't be able to recover fast enough between those sessions until the repeated bout effect ramps up so for the bridge I recommend running either a push-pull leg split on six days per week or an upper lower split done four days per week this way you hit each muscle twice a week with at least a few days of recovery in between and my bridge program I include both options depending on your availability to train okay so that's the intro side of the bridge now let's take a look at the transition side this one's a bit easier basic idea here is to just gradually start adding stuff at this point we can start turning the dials up as we gradually load more heavily so we can turn the intensity up on the compound list to an RPE of six or seven by increasing the weight on the bar and we can turn up the intensity on isolation exercises to an RP of eight or nine as long as soreness is decreasing and recovery is improving now for volume as long as you find yourself recovering well you can start to slowly increase the number of sets so if you're doing two sets per exercise for the intro phase you can increase that to three sets per exercise especially for exercises you want to put more emphasis on okay so after the transition phase you've officially bridged yourself to a point where you can start training normally again using the progression methods appropriate for your level of advancement so for most of you you should be able to continue making great progress just using a simple linear progression for at least to the next month or two from here this means you can add some weight increment say five to twenty pounds from week to week without needing to vary the rep ranges just simple progressions should be enough to get you making size and strength gains until you hit a plateau and at that point you're gonna need to start methodically tweaking variables like volume intensity frequency and exercise selection to keep driving the progress forward alright so like I said guys you can pick up my new four-week bridge program over on Geoff nipper comm for free also part two of this video on how to set up your nutrition after a training break is on the way next so don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss that one also there's a full blog article covering the sign to details I covered in this video over on my website if you guys would like to check that out don't forget to leave me a
