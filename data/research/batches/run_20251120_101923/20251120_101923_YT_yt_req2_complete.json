  "transcript": "hey how you doing today I am coach Ryan family we are here in the Viper pit I am going to talk to you today about how to jump back into the weight room after a layoff uh if you remember from my last video I've taken 5 weeks completely out of the gym to resensitize my body to the weight room now if I did like what most people do I would jump right back in full boore guns of Blazing with the hardest most intense program to try to stick simulate fast results that would be a mistake and that's why most people burn out after a short period of time in the gym so today I want to talk about what you do what what should your training look like when you're coming back from a layoff um I've been fairly highly trained for a while I've trained many many years and so with this layoff I haven't lost everything that I've ever worked for but I am detrained a little bit not to the point where I'm winded trying to tie my shoes or anything like that but I'm noticeably starting to get a little bit out of shape so what should the training program look like well there's first there's going to be five kind of rules or guidelines that I like when reintroducing someone to the gym and this also goes for introducing someone to the gym if they've never trained before you shouldn't smash right out of the gate okay save the Hulk smash for when you deserve it from more modest training number one training should be easy that's right right at the beginning it should be easy what does that mean means if I'm doing a set of 10 reps I'm going to use a weight that I could probably do 15 to 20 with if I really pushed it hard um I'm not taking it to failure and I'm not doing a ton of work sets I'm not pushing to the point where I'm puking or sick or anything like that trying to gradually get back into the game number two it should be short right now I'm looking at maybe 20 minute workout okay after the warm-up so when we start basically 20 good minutes of reasonable work you don't have the energy reserves you don't have the Adaptive reserves to put in a long workout if you're coming from a layoff all right number three should build your work capacity this training is basically a phase to get me in shape for the harder training down the road if I come right in and start doing heavy singles in the squat uh while I'm in a detrained state I'm just going to get injured and I'm not going to lay a foundation on which I can approve that squat later okay so I'm going to do things that are going to build my work capacity basically train me to be able to train down the road number four no intensifiers this is a big one a lot of people when they get back in the gym they're doing Drop sets rest Paws clusters all this crazy stuff um taking sets to failure I leave that for the first uh forget about it for the first few weeks back in the gym we don't want to do any intensifiers we don't want to make it overly hard to recover from just basic training is going to stimulate you enough if you've been completely off so there's no need to play your best Trump cards right out of the gate and last but not least training should be fun all right when you're coming back from a layoff you want to do things that are enjoyable to you that you really like to do and also uh I could put number six Target your weaknesses okay I'm coach Ryan Finley from the Viper pit if you found this video informative please hit subscribe below and I'll see you next time",
