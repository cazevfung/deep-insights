We offer a comprehensive line of dynamic checkweighers suitable for food, pharmaceutical, chemical and other industries. For challenging production environments, our hygienic checkweigher range is rated IP69 and can withstand strict cleaning procedures and most caustic detergents. A wide variety of spacing, handling and sorting options accommodate nearly any package design. Our FlashCell EMFR load cell technology delivers precise weighing results, even at high speeds of up to 800 packages per minute. This automated weighing technology helps deliver accurate product amounts, reduced product waste and optimized production processes.\nIndustrial Metal Detectors\nInspect food, pharmaceutical and other product types for metal contaminants, including unpackaged and packaged products on conveyors, bulk free-falling powders or granules, vertical form fill and seal applications, and pumped liquids, pastes, and slurries in pipes. When inspecting food, metal detection systems help protect consumers from potentially harmful metal contaminants, while also helping manufacturers comply with food safety inspection standards and protect their brand. Our pharmaceutical metal detectors are self-contained inspection systems designed to check all tablets, capsules, and pharmaceutical powders for metal contaminants. In addition to protecting consumers, these systems are important for quality control and promoting compliance with regulatory requirements.\nX-ray Inspection Equipment\nX-ray inspection systems provide quality assurance in manufacturing by detecting physical contamination and performing quality checks in one automated inspection system. Food and pharmaceutical manufacturers worldwide rely on industrial x-ray inspection systems to help protect the welfare of their consumers and the reputation of their brand, reduce the risk of costly product recalls, and support regulatory compliance.\nOur x-ray inspection systems deliver product quality control at every stage of the production process for raw materials, bulk-flow, pumped, and packaged products. The presence of foil or metallized film packaging does not affect the sensitivity of contaminant detection by the x-ray system.\nVision Inspection Systems\nMachine vision technology is used to check product label quality across all market segments and packaging types. Our vision inspection solutions are also capable of performing additional integrity and quality checks on product packaging. They accurately inspect screw or snap-on caps and lids and check the accuracy and quality of labels and packaging on plastic containers, glass bottles, jars, flat packages, cartons, and pill packs. These automated optical inspection systems operate at high speeds, allowing you to maintain production throughput levels without compromising label and package quality.\nCombination Inspection Systems\nFor manufacturing facilities with limited floor space, we provide combination systems that integrate multiple inspection technologies at a single control point on your production line.
