Furthermore, with our global\nnetwork of accredited mass calibration laboratories, you can be sure of trustworthy calibration\nservices and benefit from short weight recalibration times.\n```\nWeights: Test Weights\nTest Weights\nCalibration Certificate Included\nMonitoring the performance of your weighing equipment is a requirement of\nmany standards, such as GMP and ISO 9001. Your internal quality assurance\ndepartment may also specify what testing is necessary. In addition, audits of\nweighing equipment typically require documented proof of balance testing and\ncalibration that can be traced to official reference standards.\nMETTLER TOLEDO‘s stainless steel test weights with a calibration certificate satisfy the highest\nrequirements for periodic balance performance checks. Each test weight is delivered with\na  calibration certificate from a METTLER TOLEDO calibration laboratory that has been produced\nin accordance with ISO / IEC 17025 requirements to fulfill metrological traceability requirements.\n- OIML Classes E1, E2, F1, F2, M1 with a calibration certificate\n- ASTM Classes 1– 4 with a calibration certificate\n```\nA CarePac only contains two\ncarefully selected weights – all\nyou need for safe and accurate\nweighing processes between\nmanufacturer-performed\ncalibrations.\n```\n```\nOur accredited mass calibration\nlaboratories meet or exceed\nISO / IEC 17025 standards.

Two test weights are carefully selected to\ncorrespond to 5 percent and 100 percent of your balance’s capacity – precisely\nwhat USP Chapter 41 recommends for balance testing.\n```\nTailored to your specific requirements, the three sizes of\nCarePac weight sets enable you to test balances of up\nto 8 kilograms weighing capacity. CarePac weights are\nspecified to validate process tolerances up to 0.03 percent.\n```\n```\nAll CarePac sets are delivered with a calibration certificate\nand include tweezers, gloves and other accessories for\nprofessional weight handling.\n```\n```\nWith just two carefully selected\nweights, a CarePac has every-\nthing you need for efficient routine\nbalance testing in accordance\nwith USP Chapter 41 and GWP®.\n```\n```\nAll CarePac sets have the option\nto add a third weight to accom-\nmodate individual testing require-\nments. The nominal value of the\nthird weight is between 1 miligram\nand 100 grams.\n```\nEffortless Weight Selection Optional Third Weight\n```\nSupplied as standard with each\nCarePac are ergonomic accesso-\nries such as tweezers or weight\nforks and a cleaning cloth.

Monobloc\nweights are designed for long-\nterm stability, and weights with\nan adjusting cavity simplify\nweight adjustment without the\nneed for specialized equipment.\n```\n```\nOur unique manufacturing pro-\ncess involves traditional me-\nchanical polishing, final stage\nelectrolytic polishing, fully auto-\nmated cleaning and final calibra-\ntion using state-of-the-art mass\ncomparators.\n```\nDesign and Construction Expertly Crafted\n```\nTo protect the integrity of the\nweight and ensure a long life-\ntime, all weights are supplied in\na robust, easy-to-clean plastic\ncontainer. Approved materials,\nincluding foam inserts, make\nthem a durable solution.\n```\nProtection and Longevity\nHigh quality stainless steel test weights provide the best way to verify balance\nand scale performance and prevent out-of-specification errors. Premium stainless\nsteel weights are corrosion resistant and provide long-term stability over their\nentire life span.\n```\nUsing test weights without a calibration certificate may be acceptable in certain cases. However, test\nweights with a calibration certificate provide a more comprehensive option in case documentation\nshould ever be requested. Certification relates to verifying and documenting accuracy. Even if not\nrequired by regulations, using test weights with a calibration certificate provides the reassurance that all\nyour weight measurements can be validated at any time. For example, working according to ISO 9001\nrequires documented metrological traceability, so test weights with a certificate are necessary.\n```\n- OIML Classes E1, E2, F1, F2, M1 without a

However, the manual process is\nchallenging when sampling air-sensitive reactions, reactions at elevated pressure,\nor heterogeneous mixtures. Poor sampling reproducibility and delays in quenching\ncan lead to variable results and analytical inaccuracies. EasySampler™ was\ndesigned to eliminate these challenges by providing an automated and robust\ninline method of taking representative samples from reactions.\n```\nIt is labor intensive or impos-\nsible to sample reactions that\nare air- or moisture-sensitive,\nat  elevated pressure or sub-\nambient temperature, or highly\ntoxic. EasySampler’s unique\nprobe enables sample capture\nand immediate quench so\nsamples are representative\nof the reaction at the time of\nsampling.\n```\n```\nSampling reactions with preci sion\nis challenging, especially for het-\nerogeneous or multiphase reac-\ntions.
