  "content": "What's going on everyone? Austin John please here and today we're going to be taking our first look at Pocopia or Piccopia and hopefully I learn how to say the name Pokemon Pootopia. Let's see if the Pokémon Company is able to capture that same love that we had during the World Health Organization's mandated Animal Crossing two months of game time. Pocoia or Picopia. Okay, little little chill sun animation. There's a ruined Pokemon center, a Tang Growth with glasses, broken glasses, holding a TM. Uh, also this Tang Growth has gray hair for some reason. Okay, here's what we saw before. You got the Ditto popping out of the Pokeball. So, is this like a like a post-apocalyptic world? Like after humanity is gone, Pokémon remain. Okay, Ditto goes and finds I'm just going to call it Professor Tang Growth. Okay, now we're in game play. Look at that. Ditto's found a rather unique looking Tang Growth to chat with. Let's have a listen. Oh, I suppose you might not fully understand what they're saying. So, how about I interpret? That's Zuks, a human. H, wait a moment. Are you a ditto? Oh, it is Professor Tangrove. Okay. Professor Tang Growth, it's been quite some time since I last laid eyes on a human or another Pokemon. The grass and trees are withered and dry. And all those humans and Pokémon who once lived here, they're gone. But that was then. Things have changed. Love me some P post-apocalyptic gaming. Hope springs a new. When you're playing the game, do they have voices? finally shown on the lonely professor Tang Growth cuz that was the person narrating the video interpreting begin rebuilding what happens in the actual game habitats will attract Pokémon Charmander I know him different Pokémon Jigglypuff comats war turtle slowpoke make lots of friends you'll need to create habitats that suit each Pokemon's individual preferences here's a punching Okay, I kept Chan. What happens if you place a fishing rod and a chair by the seashore? Look, a Magikarp. Pokémon with big personalities will diverse habitats. And Scyther. I don't know how Scyther was hiding in the grass like that, but he was. A Pokémon is rustling around in there. Is it garbage? Surely it's only trash. It's garbage. Your new Pokemon friends may teach you their signature moves like Squirtle's water gun. It can revitalize dried up things. Use the moves you learn to refresh the land, clear paths, till fields, grow vegetables, drills arms, and more. Expanding the places you can visit and what you can achieve. Certain Pokémon can also teach you special moves. For example, you can transform into Lapras. While Dittle might not start out as the best swimmer, this transformation makes traveling to distant islands a breeze. So, you get to go to other islands. Transforming into dragon. You can reach far off places in no time. Okay. How expansive is this world? We can make you can craft out a workbench using the materials you've collected. Okay, good. Here's the here's the the the itch the Animal Crossing game loop. Take a few leaves and ta a straw bed furniture and toys to street houses vending machines. Use the items you craft to build a beautiful town, floating platform more comfortable as you transform your space into a vibrant place to live. Okay, I'm digging this. Oho, you made some toy blocks. Baby Pokémon. I haven't the foggiest idea how to use them properly. Alakaz Kazam does. So, we saw Abra and we saw Alakazam. That means the Pokémon can evolve. Can have unique requests for you. Looks like Squirtle wants to go somewhere. It's up to you to find a way to lead them where they want to go. Okay, so we get missions. Cool. You may also find Pokémon who need your help stuck in harsh, desolate areas. And you'll need to work together with other Pokémon to complete particularly important requests. Important request underway. Your Pokemon friends will help you rebuild your world. They can light campfires, get light shining, and so much more. Yeah, but my question is like, if you work together, are they just going to do this stuff on their own? You can even build grand houses or like do every day you have to go and grab your Pikachu and tell it to go turn the the lights on. The Pikachu fountain is complete. And Pikachu looks off. Although upon closer inspection, this Pikachu is a rather curious expression. Snap a photo of your new renovations. You can capture your memories and add them to your outfit. You can customize your character. Then change up your look. Be a sailor, a kung fu guy. Don't forget to decorate your room. Yeah. And just like Animal Crossing and get to decorate your interior. Multiplayer. Up to four friends can join in the You just get to build the house brick by brick. Build a delightful life together with your closest friends. Game share is also supported. That's kind of cool. You can share the game with someone who doesn't own it and play together on Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 systems. Oh, this game is coming out on Switch One. I thought it was only Switch 2. Whether solo or with friends, you're free to do whatever you want. From granting Pokémon requests to building the town of your dreams. Set out on an adventure to create a flourishing world. Espeon Gardavir. Live in peace. Goodra comfort. Arcanine. Pokemonia. Oh, Smeargle. He's painting. Where is it, boy? What is that? A ghost of a Pikachu. All the lanterns are turning blue now. Looks pretty spooky. Is that a grass-type Snorlax? Are we getting delta species? This may be the first noncore Pokémon game that I'm interested in playing. Like I I didn't really give a chance or really enjoy Mystery Dungeon and like the offshoot games like that. Granted, I did enjoy Stadium cuz that's basically just a core game, but like the games that you can't bring the Pokemon into Pokemon Bank or Home throughout time. This might be the first one. Like I'm going to give this a solid 20 hours to see if it hooks me for like the ultimate customizability because I've done like a lot of Minecraft. I did as you know a lot of Animal Crossing. Um so like can I do grand things in a game? Can I spend 10 12 hours gathering resources, expanding things to customize areas? What level of customizability do we have? Like one of the great parts of Animal Crossing New Horizons was u the QR code scanner and being able to to modify with, you know, the very basic drawing of the pixels for different patterns that we saw and stuff. Are we going to see that implemented here as well? And it's coming out a week after Pokémon Day. So March 5th, so 3526 Poptopia. Also, this is a game key card game, which kind of sucks, but honestly, I don't really care. The only games that I want physical is like the core Pokemon games. I'm going to wait until like the day before release and then I'm going to go ahead and pre-order this game and preload it onto my system. I want to know how many Pokémon are in the game. I want to know if you can evolve them. I want to know if there's a way to catalog all the ones who have come to your island or that you obtained or however that's going to work. Like, what are they doing to make this more Pokémon than Animal Crossing? And what level of customizability are we going to be having? What's that on the cover? What is that right there? Is that the ghost Pikachu? Logging into the press website, I could see that it's called Mosslax. That's the mossy covered Snorlax. And this Pikachu is P E A K Y C Hu. Pikachu. Smearguru. Oh, so he's like the guru of that. Got it. So you have these four modified Pokémon. So, here's a really interesting thing. So, we've seen this key visual uh since when this was first came out. When was this? Uh September 12th, right? We've seen this key visual. Look at right here by this bellsprout. The updated visual has Professor Tang Growth. It has Smearguru. Over here, we have the the ghost Pikachu. So, they omitted things from the original key art that are now present in the new key art. Really interested what this Pikachu is going to be. This game, I'm excited for it. I want to play it again. I'm just curious if it's really gonna hook me. Like, it has to have that game loop that keeps me that keeps my my add brain highly engaged. So, we'll see. Did you watch my Animal Crossing series? And if so, are you interested in Pokia? Uh, leave it down below. Thank you so much for being here. Until next time, Austin John out. Man, they see me shining like I got the charm. Stay strapped. Got that jet ball in my palm. Felt from the sky. Guess I'm the chosen one. And if you need to know how, check out Austin John. Champion flow. Yeah, I got that champion flow. Float. Yeah, I got that.",
