  "transcript": "Pokemon Company released this blight on us during the last Nintendo Direct and I'm honestly still reeling about it, but like we have to talk about it, right? We can't just gloss over that this thing exists. And the thing being Pootopia. So, what actually is Poptopia? By all accounts, it seems like a sort of bog standard life/crafting simulator. If anything, the trailer lacked on is telling us the goal or structure of the game. It just kind of showed us that we can craft stuff and that we meet Pokémon along the way, which is cool and all and conceptually that sounds fun, but that's not what people are talking about. People are talking about the player, a Ditto. But like, not just Ditto. Ditto that is trying to be a person. This thing is uncomfortable to say the least. The implications alone are insane, and we'll get into them, but like, is this cute? Who is this for? The reactions online I've seen are 50/50, represented best by me and my wife, respectively. He was myself and Dan Cyburn's reaction on seeing it. But what what you doing, bud? Uh oh. Oh my god. He's got a Pokédex. But Ditto's Adventure. Uh oh, he has a Pokédex. Oh. Oh. Oh no. Oh wait. I'm kind of in. This land is just waiting. I'm kind of in. Hey, I'm counting this as new Pokémon. Did I put that down? What's this? Looks like Ditto's got an idea. I did. Oh no. Oh my Oh, maybe I maybe I don't like this game by learning this. And then here's my wife's reaction on seeing it. What? Huh? It's so cute for the pump. So again, like this thing is cute. I don't know. I think I'm more uncomfortable by it than actually liking the thing. But I can't deny that it has some kind of charm. And I think the more I look at it, the more I get used to it. And the more I get used to it, the more I do end up kind of liking it. But there is nothing that will make me forget the absolute body horror I felt when seeing this thing stretch its arms for the first time. So like, is this the Animal Crossing replacement? Cuz again, it's not quite a life sim. It's more of a crafting game, I guess. We don't have a lot of details. So, is this just going to be a bad Minecraft or is there going to be some goal in mind for making this island better? It's unclear as of now, especially since Animal Crossing itself is getting a massive update, which let's talk about it now. Just recently, they announced that Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be receiving a Switch 2 update and a free update alongside it. The Switch do update gives you a better resolution, more people over your island, mouse controls, a megaphone that you can use to find people on your island. And look, all of this is cool, but personally, I don't really see the point. I don't know why I would want to pay $10 extra dollars for a slightly better resolution. It's Animal Crossing. I get it. But as confused as I am that all the cool stuff is in the free update, I'm actually really happy that all the cool stuff is in the free update because the free update is where the meat of it is. Not only do we get some crossover stuff, they're adding Lego, Zelda, and Splatoon items, as well as a few custom villagers for the Zelda and Splatoon universes, but they're also adding Nintendo consoles, retro toys, and playable NES and Game Boy game decorations, which is some of my favorite things that I really missed in this version of Animal Crossing. The only Animal Crossing I really played a lot of was the original on Gamecube, and one of my favorite parts about it was collecting those little playable arcade machines that you could put in your house. You could play like Ice Climbers and stuff on this stuff. It wasn't like amazing or anything, but it was just a fun little side objective and it looks like they're bringing that back to New Horizons. Now, it looks like maybe it's only a very few select and you might need Nintendo Switch Online to do it. I don't know if so that's kind of lame, but at least it's here at all. They're also adding an upgraded item storage, which like cool, I guess, if you're into that. The dream world is getting an update as well as these new things they're calling Slumber Islands. Now, at first I got really excited cuz people said you could have up to three islands now. I was like, hell yeah. But I think they were mistaken. They're talking about slumber islands, which are cool and all, but they're more like doll houses than playable islands. They're things you can make things look exactly the way you want to in, which again is awesome for the people that like making very specific islands, but it's not three playable islands. But again, talking about how cool this update is, none of this is the big ticket item. That being the resort hotel they're adding to the pier. Essentially, Kappen's family is opening a hotel. And not only can you design rooms for guests, but those guests can wander around your island. And you can get not only villagers you haven't had yet, but other characters from throughout the series. And that's awesome. There's like a whole new shop involved with it. There's so much more content about just this hotel alone. I'm going to probably play Animal Crossing: New Horizons again. We have to dust it off since I haven't played it in years, but Nintendo knew that people haven't played it in years. They added Recetti back, and his whole goal is he can wipe out parts of your island, clean up weeds for you, get rid of bugs. It's definitely like the, \"Hey, we get it. Here's a quick way to clean up your island so you can start playing again.\" But as awesome as all this is, my question still wraps back to Poptopia. If we're getting this massive Animal Crossing New Horizons update and Tomodachi Life is coming out soon, who is Poptopia for? Because again, it looks really cute. And admittedly, it's a crafting game before anything else. So, it's not quite the same game as Animal Crossing or Tomodachi Life, but it is still in the life sim category. and we have two options that are both very highly anticipated. I'm happy Pokémon is branching out, but I have not great hopes for Poketopia to be honest with you. I feel like it's going to be overshadowed by Tomodachi Life and the new updates for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. But who knows, maybe I'm wrong. After all, we still don't know a lot of information about what Poptopia is. We just know you can craft and you're this weird abomination. But let me know what you think about it in the comments below. In the meantime, you've been watching Right to Of all the YouTube channels. It's the second one.",
