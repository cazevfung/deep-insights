  "transcript": "great so hi again everyone uh thank you for having me I'm a third year PhD student or now I should say now that it's summer I'm a rising fourth year PhD student the computer science department at Stanford working with Michael Bernstein and Brazilian um and today I'll talk to you about generative agents interactive simulacra of human behavior and this is work I developed with my advisors Michael and Percy as well as my collaborators and mentors Mary Morris and Kerry Kai and my mentee Joey O'Brien okay thank you four over four decades now from the time of cognitive architectures and symbolic systems to statistical machine learning we the researchers and practitioners at the intersection of human computer interaction and AI Envision the ability to simulate believable human behavior behavior that is so compelling and so human-like that they provide an illusion of life in our vision this ability is achieved promised a new class of interactive applications ranging from model human processors for usability testing to social robots NPCs and ubiquitous Computing applications that require a rich understanding of human combination and if to the foundation of small and large-scale social simulations that would test social science and economics theories that are difficult to implement in real lives but despite their wide application spaces we faced fermental challenges when simulating human behavior the space of possibility the way we behave and communicate we found was much too advanced and too complex to navigate with existing methods but I see a new opportunity that is emerging now in general the models such as large language models that are being trained today are trained on Broad data that reflect our lives like the traces on our social web Wikipedia and more so as a result of that these models encode a tremendous amount about us how we live talk and behave so I positive the right method they can be transformed into the core ingredient that had been missing the past decades that will enable us to simulate believable human behavior so today I will introduce a new way of simulating human behavior in fully General computational relations they can populate an open world like ours by fusing a large language model with a novel agent architecture that remembers reflects and plans based on constantly growing memories and cascading social dynamics these agents I will demonstrate can not only plan and lead a believable day in life where they wake up in the morning do their routines and go to work as individuals in a Sandbox game environment but they can also come together to give birth to an entirely artificial Society of their own like the one you see here where each agents will have their own subjective memory and experience and autonomously spread information from relation form relationships and coordinate amongst each other before reflecting on the past days and deciding on how they will live tomorrow these are generative agents in these generative agents I'm going to suggest open up a new genre of human AI interaction that is fueled by our new fundability to simulate believable human behavior Okay so with that maybe quickly demonstrate to you um in more detail a small bill so this is a setting of our demonstration for generative agents and the mode of agent interaction that takes place in it so small bill is a Sandbox Sandbox game environment that we developed featuring The Common affordances of a small village ranging from houses Apartments Cafe bars School stores and the sub areas and objects that make the area functional like the bathroom kitchen and common family house and a Bookshop and a table in the common room and we populated the space with 25 generated patients and initialized each of them with one paragraph of natural language description to depict each Asian's identity including their occupation and relationship with other agents and seal it is paragraph into the agent's memory at the start of the simulation and that is it that is all the input that we ever give to these agents then these agents interact with their environment through their actions based on their own volition and here's how this works in Smallville so first the agents generate the natural language statement describing their current action such as Isabella Rodriguez is drinking coffee they then translate this into concrete movements that affect the sandbox game environment along with the automatically generated emojis they visually describe the Asian sections and they can influence the state of the objects in the game world so a bed can be occupied when an agent is slipping and the refrigerator can be empty when an agents uses up the ingredients to make breakfast then to interact with each other they determine whether they want to engage in conversations when they see another agent and they decide and they actually generate natural language dialogue if they decide to engage like this dialogue between Isabella and Tom about Seymour who's a fellow agent in the Smallville initiated with a memory that he is running for local mayor so here you see Isabella saying I'm still doing my options but I've been discussing the election with some more what are your thoughts on him and you say calm responding to Isabella to be honest I don't like similar I think he's out of touch with the community and doesn't have our best interest at heart and importantly the users can also influence and interact with these agents first much like how Asians form dialogue with each other a user can engage in a dialogue with these agents by specifying a Persona that the agent should perceive them as so for instance if the user specifies that they are a news reporter and asks about the upcoming election in Smallville who is running for office Isabella might reply Sam or to directly command one of the agents the user can take on the Persona of the agent's inner voice and this makes the agent more likely to treat the statement as a directive so if the user tells John that he's now running for the office while taking the Persona of John's inner voice John would decide to run an election and share his candidacy with his family and friends second just as agents can the user can also alter the state of the agent's environments so for instance if the user sets Isabella's toast on fire is available rush to put out the fire and remake her toast yeah and finally the user can actually control an agent by embodying an agent already present in the world such as Isabella and John or join as an outside visitor the inhabitants of Smallville will treat the user-controlled agent no differently than they treat each other they will actually recognize its presence initiate interactions and remember its behavior before forming opinions about it so let me dive deeper and present you with some vignettes from Smallville that describe their individual as well as collective emergent Behavior a little more in detail so as individuals generative agents create daily plans they reflect their experiences execute those plans react and replan when appropriate so I'm going to give you an example so here is an example day in the life of the Lin family so on the map you see the Lin family located the bottom right corner of the map the Lynn family is a family of three so it has the mother may who's a college professor the Father John who is a historic clerk at a local pharmacy in the sun area who is a student at a college who studies music theory in the Ling family John is the first to wake up at 6 00 am he brushes his teeth takes a shower and Cooks breakfast and throughout the morning other family members follow suit catch up with each other and by 8 AM head out to their respectable places so may and Eddie goes to college and John to the pharmacy let's eave drop on them a little bit to get a sense of what they talk about in the morning again their movements the decision to engage in these dialogues in the dialogue themselves are all generated so nothing you see here is hard coded so here John and Eddie are catching up in the morning John says good morning Eddie and Eddie says good morning Dad and John asks what are you working on today and adding response I'm working on a new music competition and only a little after the conversation May wakes up and doing strong by now Eddie already left for his classes but John recalls the conversation he and his son just had and finds that to be relevant here he updates me that Eddie's working on a new music competition for his class and main response oh that's wonderful and meanwhile as a collective in this practical small Society of generative agents generative agents exhibits emergent social dynamics where new relationships form information diffuses and coordination arises let me go over these emergent behaviors so first information diffuses across this Asian Community we've already seen a glimpse of this with the limb family but here is one more example so we see the same with a memory that he is running for a local election and he is telling everyone about it throughout the day here he tells Tom I'm actually running for mayor in the upcoming election and Tom says really that's great news and a few hours later in the game wall John and Tom her colleagues at the local store and Pharmacy and have independently heard the biosense candidacy talk to each other about sense chances of winning John says I heard this in Moore is running for mayor do you think he has a good chance of winning and here Tom responds I think he'll get a lot of support and second new relationships form among the generative agents in Smallville so here's one example Latoya and Sam do not know each other at the start of the simulation but while taking a walk in Johnson Park Sam runs into Latoya and they introduce themselves Latoya tells him that she is at the park to take some photos for a project that she's working on in the next day when samsi satoya again here and Latoya remember each other the Samsung asked Latoya how's your project going finally age of coordination spontaneously emerges in this model in our demonstration we set the starting date to be on February 13th and with Isabella who is the owner of hops Cafe we see it in intent to plan a Valentine's Day party from 5 to 7 pm on February 14th from that seat alone Isabella invites her friends and customers slippery spends the afternoon of the 13th decorating the cafe for the occasion and enlist Maria who is a friend and a frequent customer at the cafe for help and meanwhile Mary actually asks Klaus who is her secret crush to go to the party with her and on the day of the Valentine's Day party five agents including Klaus and Maria actually show up at hops Cafe at 5 pm and they enjoy the festivities so how do we do this how did we achieve this agent Behavior our main architecture in this world is basically this architecture represented in this figure this is the architecture of generative agents that powers each of these agents in Smallville at the center of this architecture is what we call the memory stream it is the primary database that maintains a comprehensive record of an agent's experience in natural language from the memory stream records are retrieved as relevant to the agent's cognitive processes and so let me go over the modules of this architecture in just a little bit more detail actually starting with the memory component so memory and retrieval here's a challenge that we're trying to overcome with this module generative agents in Smallville and likely Beyond accrue an extremely large set of Records in their memory stream and fitting the entire memory stream to a language model can distract the model and today not even a few hours worth of memory in Smallville can even fit into the limited context window of the state-of-the-art language models such as Chaturbate or gpt4 so our agents need to find need a way to store and selectively retrieve portions of their memory and that's the aim of the memory stream and the retrievable function so here is the tip of the memory for an agent Isabella and on the right you see a few example memory objects in the Stream that contain a piece of memory described in natural language with a creation time timestamp in particular here what you're seeing are observational membrane of Isabella and based on this memory stream our architecture implements a retriever function that takes the agent's current situation as input and returns a subset of the memory stream to pass on to the Lynch model which then generates the final output Behavior of the agent so in this example if the situation that Isabella is trying to react to is someone asking what are you looking forward to the most right now she will retrieve things that are about the Quarry and formulate a response I'm looking forward to the Valentine's Day party here is how the retrieval function works in our architecture we designed this as a combination of the recency importance and relevance functions for each piece of memory so basically we biased towards retrieving memories that are more recent more important and more relevant in our work recency function is implemented as an exponential decay function so as time goes on the older memory gets exponentially further to get retrieved just probably in terms of its probability the importance function is a prompt that asks the language model for an event saliency so this is an interesting one conceptually this is almost like just asking the agent this happened to you is this important for you so it could be something like what I ate for breakfast this morning might not be so important for most people including myself but let's say when you graduate from college or when you break up with somebody those are highly important uh events that the agent will likely choose to remember and rank Highland and the relevance function is a cosine similarity feature of the embeddings of the query sentence in the description of the memory so that one is likely the one that we are very much familiar with now what we notice in our world is that with just the wrong observational memory our agents struggle to generalize to make inferences so periodically we synthesize clusters of Records in agents and memory streaming to a higher level abstract thoughts that are called the reflections and unfortunately once they are synthesized these Reflections are just a type of memory so they are stored in the memory stream just like the observational memory here's the way we do this we first generate questions on what to reflect them by looking at the 100 most recent records in the agents memory stream so if an agent just had lunch it could be something like what does the agent like to eat then we retrieve records that are relevant to answering those questions which might be things like the age of eight on almond today yesterday and the day before yesterday and we synthesized that into a reflection maybe the Asian like Street dominates over time what this generates is basically this trees of Reflections the leaf nodes are observations and the non-leaf nodes are thoughts that become higher level higher of the three they go so here's one for Clause so for context Clauses a um a college student a college researcher who studies social science so at the very bottom of this uh tree for instance if you look at the lower bottom corner of classes 3 here you actually see his observational memories such as Klaus is reading about gentrification he's reading about Urban Design these are factual memory and that is saved in classes memory in this case likely he is just basically reflecting or remembering the things he did throughout the day at the lower level what this gets uh synthesized into is fairly branded reflection like Cloud spends many hours reading so it's fairly grounded but that's still now starts to get into this idea of Reflections because that's no longer a fact it's a summary of the known facts now ultimately what this ends up getting grouped into is higher level Reflections along with the other observations like he's making connection between articles a lot of basically research related activities which gets summarized into something like Klaus is engaging in research activities and other Reflections here might include Clauses dedicated to research and so forth and all that gets mapped into the highest level reflection something like he is dedicated to these highly dedicated to research which starts to answer questions about who Klaus is and right so basically uh what we are seeing here is we're basically following that process and again higher up the tree you go it really starts to answer questions like in this particular instance now you're really starting to get into the territory of who Klaus is what drives and what is he passionate about but we can also imagine this kind of trees being formed about their colleagues or their environment okay imagine in this case a clouds might have a tree that looks like this for Isabella as well who is an acquaintance that he has met throughout the day and finally one large Range model can generate plausible behavior in response to situational information we find that optimizing for believability in the moment can this can sacrifice the believability over time so what we needed was for the agents to plan over a longer time Horizon so please describe a future sequence of actions for the agent and help keep the agent's Behavior consistent over time for instance for Klaus who is a student researcher dedicated in this research and has an impending deadline he will generate plans to spend his day working at his desk drafting his research paper in our work we generate the plans by prompting a large Lynch model with a prompt that summarizes the agent and agent's current status as you see here for editing so at the top you basically see some summary description of Eddie and below the current status what is it reacting to uh what's his like current plans and so forth a challenge here however is controlling through the granularity of the planes that are being generated in our work we control for this by taking a top-down approach where we recursively generate more plants in detail so here's an example and the left hand side is Eddie's plant generated in Broad Strokes the devices stays into roughly seven chunks and we then decompose these chunks first into our lists schedule and then into 5 to 15 minute actions that you see on the right hand side once we reach the desired granularity in the agent's schedule they actually act out the plans in the game world now what's actually nice about having this sort of this recursive function is as really needed you can go on either extreme so you can create even larger sequence plans that talks about what are we going to do this month this year and so forth or you can break this down into even smaller pieces into for instance minute by minute sequences for the purpose uh of our own project for the game environment we basically found that 5 to 15 minute uh chunks is actually a reasonable interval for us to create interesting and believable behavior in the game world but sometimes but sometimes the agents may need to change their plans for instance if ex-father John records that he sees Eddie taking a short walk in the house Garden he might decide to start an impromptu conversation we prompt a large language modulation here to make this determination and edit the agent's plans if the situation calls for their responses so I described to you our agents behavior and our Asian architecture basically how we achieve the behavior so now we can ask how do we evaluate these agents so the main dependent variable that we use is believability which has been a long which has long been a central design and Engineering goal in a line of Prior literature so basically we're asking do agents remember plan act react and reflect in an accurate manner and to evaluate generative agents believability we're leveraging methodological Opportunity by interviewing it in natural language in particular we craft five categories of questions five questions each where to respond to these questions properly the agents must successfully retrieve and synthesize information to stay in character remember plan react and reflect in an accurate manner so I'll give you a few example questions here and answers from Klaus when we ask them to give an introduction of himself he properly record his name and characteristics so you see Cloud's basically saying my name is Klaus I'm 20 years old a student and so forth and when you when we asked him what he would do when his breakfast is burning he tells us that he would quickly turn off the stove and make sure the food doesn't continue burning our aesthetic procedure was as follows we test Our Generation architecture as well as the ablated architectures and human authors to answer the questions we then asked 100 human evaluators to rank the answers from the different conditions and then we calculated true skill rating for each conditions which is a generalization of the ELO rating system so if you if you're sort of familiar with the chess uh how chess players get rated they get rated by this parallelized comparison like yellow rating and true score basically generalizes that so it can go beyond just the pairwise comparison so in this case we have five conditions we're asking which of the conditions succeed uh the most in terms of their ability what we find is that the components of our agent protection observation plan and reflection each contribute critically to the believability of the agent architecture so the red bar is the performance of our architecture and it's significantly outperforms every other conditions including the human author condition it is also worth noting that when compared to the condition representing prior work which is the no reflection plan and observation condition and I'm here I'm really referring to some of the works uh that has come out in the past year or so they try to use a large language model to simulate or to replicate social science experiments or sex studies will support simply by prompting them um our full generative Asian architecture produces a standardized effect size of coincidence d That's equal to 8.16 another way of saying that is that's a standard deviation difference from the sort of the water is considered to be our current state of the art of course I will note here that this did not mean that our agents work without flaws they would sometimes fail to retrieve certain memories like when Rajiv answered I have been following the election too closely even though he talked to Sam to hear about his candidacy and they will sometimes embellish their memories also for instance Isabella was aware of Sam's candidacy in the election and she confirmed this when she was asked but she also added that he was going to make an announcement tomorrow even though Sam had mentioned no such plans additionally we conducted an end-to-end evaluation of the ages to better understand the types of emerging community group we observed among the general equations so first we find that agents shared and remembered information seven agents heard about the sense candidacy and 12 Asians part about the Valentine's Day party you can actually see the path the part invitation to Across the Asian community on the right hand side here so you basically see Isabella saying hey I'm planning a Valentine's Day party on February 14th and she tells that to Giorgio Eddie Sam and so forth and in turn Sam also tells Jennifer who is his wife uh speaking of which Isabella has invited us to a Valentine's Day party and they decide whether they want to go together or not second we find that the agents remembered and joined the Valentine's Day party in particular five agents came to the party of the ones who didn't make it three-sided conflicts like Rajiv who is a painter who explained that he was too busy unfortunate interest in the party but still did not show up now this does make things a little bit difficult for evaluation though on one hand we might view this as an error on the other hand this actually is extremely realistic human behavior in my experience so that's that's something for uh for us to think about but of course there were boundaries and errors uh in our agent's Behavior one that is particularly noteworthy here is that the instruction tuning of the Asian model seems to guide the agent to be overly polite and Incorporated even when talking to her family for instance may always create it informally and Isabella never really refuse ideas to include in our car even when the ideas did not exactly align with her identity and I quickly answer that next question um so a small question so so how in your experiments um um I was thinking that some of these observations that you're making uh it might be possible to actually turn the world back like go back in time and kind of repeat the same experiments to see how the outcomes will change I wonder if you had it if you tried anything like that like you like kind of repeating this Valentine's Day Party throwing like a couple of times to see how like agents would react you know if you repeated like 10 times 100 times right um so that's a great question um the outcome changes so obviously um we couldn't do them multiple times with a full 25 agent uh simulation because it was too slow and expensive for now but we certainly have done that in sort of a more unit scale scenarios with three agents or five agents uh what you see is certain things called uh so just because you rerun it doesn't mean they're going through all the sudden behave in some crazy way so they still all follow the general believable pattern but as we know sort of the large language model they are not entirely deterministic so for instance unlike gpt3 for instance chpt doesn't even let us uh set the parameters for the the temperature and so forth so the models that we're using is not the humanistic so when you start in uh the simulation at the beginning there might be some small changes that continue to occur every time we rerun the experiment and what ends up happening is because there is a community of Agents their behavior is as a sort of collective it's compliance so even the small perturbance at the beginning of this simulation could actually change the outcome so to give you some example here um one thing that we track uh price because we're invested in it uh the one thing that we do track is um whether clouds in Maria will sort of ask each other out because we know they have crush on each other and there's a Valentine's Day party going on so we think it's cute um who asks who sometimes changes or that's or sometimes no one really asks each other either so those are the kind of things that could happen so one instance when we ran it once uh I think there was one time in class asked Maria out uh to go to the party with him um and it was a little bit funny that he all of a sudden would say hey Maria do you want to go to the party and do readings together and of course you know class is a little bit awkward in that way he's a he's a you know student researcher and he's really passionate about it doesn't really know how to ask somebody out on a date clearly um but when Maria asked so basically when we ran the next time and I think what ended up happening in our final experiment was thankfully it was Maria who asked class L and I think she was much more reasonable than sort of asking him out and I think she basically said hey there's the Valentine's Day party going on that my friend is organizing is going to go together um so those kind of things uh happen and they change and who me oh like the social connection um if one agent on that day didn't go to the cafe in particular they may not have met Isabella if they didn't know her already so those kind of things happen wonderful so that is generative agents um and I'm also happy to discuss this work a little bit further at the end of the talk but um what I want to quickly discuss um so thankfully uh this is an old slide but there's more interest on in the sport from both yeah we were excited about this work from their clinics perspective but there was more interest than we expected more broadly and I do think uh really one of the reasons why that is the case was the application space of generative agent was actually quite the best so for the remaining uh five to ten minutes of this talk I want to throw in one more idea uh that basically is what you can basically see as an application of generative agents that I'm quite excited about so you might notice here this paper was published uh 2022 so it was last year so this actually predates generative agent's paper but this was actually our first paper and I think first paper in the field that sort of tried to use a large language model to simulate human behavior um and of course we didn't have all this like agent architecture and so forth so the technique that I'll be demonstrating here is simply it's really prompting a large English model so this is in part what I sort of mentioned as the current method of doing things uh before using active agents um but I think you'll see that in philosophy this is basically the same line of work and especially now that we have the age and architecture in place this method we can go even further than what I've been showing you here but I at least want to show you because uh this is an application space again that I that sort of opens up a new design space for applications so this one again um so it's called social lab crap similacres is in both titles of the paper so you can see those papers are related uh so again this is with my advisor Michael and Percy as well as my maintenance key inventors again at Mary Morris and Kerry Kai so for many decades now we have designed and deployed countless social Computing systems But the irony is even today as more and more people populate these systems we continue to be surprised by the things that happen in them like unexpected trolling or southern land taxable behaviors all the into cases such as people congregating to spread hate speech and misinformation but why is this because in theory this issue of understanding how people might use an interactive system is something that we know how to tackle that's what prototypes like the ones you see here are all about but here's the challenge in my vision a successful social Computing prototype needs to prototype not for instance the user flow of how one might click around different pages but those were social dynamics that might arise when the system reaches critical massive users because that's where the uncertainty is in Social systems and there is an impossible task for our existing prototyping approaches where are we going to get thousands or even tens of thousands of diverse test users how would we protect the social dynamics that might arise without releasing these designs to a large number of people General patrons enables a new way of prototyping a social Computing system the tackles this challenge by generating a large number of synthetic social interactions that might arise in a populated social system and we call this method social similar crap social similar is an approach it is an approach of leveraging the richness and the generative capacity of models such as a large language model to populate a social Computing system with generative agents and behaviors for the purpose of prototyping the system design and we will demonstrate this in practice by implementing it as a web application tool for protecting subreddits that takes Community designs such as the goals rules and moderation strategies and translates them to a generated Community like the one you see here that has never existed before to illustrate The Good the Bad and the Ugly of the interactions that are Community governed by these designs May Harbor so let me show you what I can do powerful has three core features generate water and Multiverse and they each answer the core needs in Social Computing design so first generate prior literature suggests that social competing designers struggle to Envision the breadth of interaction that might take place in their design generate helps the designers by populating a subreddit Community with generating users tabular posts and replies to those posts to help them Envision the space so it takes from the designer a range of design specifications such as the goals rules and member competitions and returns a separated like page that is fully populated like the one you see here on the right hand side here is an example and just note in this slides everything on the left is the designer's input and everything on the right is social similar across output so in a community for connecting people moving to Los Angeles we look out social simulacra generated a new user Leon Santos who posted I'm new to La what are some of the best places to visit on a weekend and the response R2 generated Lucas Jameson who replied I would recommend visiting the Getty Center the Museum of Contemporary Art and going hiking here's another one this time in a community for people interested in learning about personal finance and soon similar generated in Wood who posted I spent 21k to go to college and they ended up with 23k in that but this time in response R2 generated Elizabeth Neal who is a troll here she said that's a lot of that man I haven't seen that much since I shop in Macy's during the holiday season the second feature what if aims to give the designers more interactive control moreover social simulator to help them explore how individual conversations might be influenced so what if takes from the designer an existing Reddit conversation and regenerates it from the middle of it as you can see here so imagine Maya Smith posted to a forum for Wist office she said I've been working on my with the paper for a few weeks and I'm feeling really stuck and to this Heather Hernandez who is a human computer interaction Professor replied with a short advice it's normal to first talk when writing a paper good luck but as a designer so you can you so you might want to know so that you can prepare for it What If instead of header a troll replied or what about an Advertiser the water feature answers to that precise need so here instead of header a troll replied you're just not cut out for this kind of research whereas here an Advertiser replied would click the link below to learn more equipped with this the designer can now even ask what could the moderator say in response to this undesirable Behavior and if the moderator intervened with no advertisements please to The Advertiser what are some of the ways the conversation could have developed from this but not the final feature is more typers and this is the feature that makes the motor uncertainty explicit so with the first two features generate and what if what I've shown you is our Tool's capacity to generate realistic content but human behavior is inherently complex and no matter how likely something is to happen there's no guarantee that it will happen and this is an important concept for scaffold for social similar and more broadly for a generative agents so instead of showing the designer one possible outcome Multiverse augments the previous two features simulate and what it my explicitly showing many possible ways the interaction can unfold from One initial state this encourages the designer to explore the design space with inductive insights rather than over relying on the one prediction made by the model so to quickly talk about evaluation uh we've actually done two sets of evaluation for social similar as well uh the first is actually technical evaluation and I skipped there for today mainly because the philosophy and sort of the outcome of evaluation uh Maps pretty nicely to generative agents so it was basically a form of what clearly considered a steering test and things come out to be believable and that was sort of our technical evaluation but what I did want to share is our designer evaluation so basically asking is social similar successful in what they are meant to achieve and what does success here really look like so for the designer evaluation we recruited 16 participants who had experience designing social spaces and ask them to design a new subreddit with the help of socialism what we find is that today without a social Simulator the design practices for social Computing systems are reactive so participant AIDS comment here is particularly Salient which says basically all the rules are said in reaction to some dumpster fire and our participants have this as the reason why social media can be really valuable because it would help it would offer them a sense of security but if they could try different iterations of establishing Norms before actually releasing their design we also find that simulabra offer complete design insights to our participants among them are finding unexpected model citizen Behavior like impromptu friends seeking to those sightseeing in a community for sharing fun events around Pittsburgh and finding unexpected undesirable Behavior like true forms Shifting the tone of our discussion community so with that so that is my talk about the generative agents and I think before I end my advisors uh collaborators and funders just one last time and thank you all for having me today",
