  "transcript": "Analytical Instruments from METTLER TOLEDO:\nTitration\nOur Analytical Instruments solutions for potentiometric titrators and Karl Fischer titrations emphasize ease of use, flexibility, and productivity. The complete range of titrators, autosamplers, sensors, and accessories covers most titration applications. Good Titration Practice™ Guidelines and comprehensive application literature ensure reliable measurement results. The unique OneClick Titration™ operation minimizes training times and accelerates workflows.\nLearn more about titration\npH, Conductivity, DO, and Ion Measurement\nFrom basic handheld meters to flexible multichannel devices, METTLER TOLEDO Analytical Instruments offers a full spectrum of high-quality pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and ion meters. The top-of-the-line SevenExcellence™ meter, for instance, provides excellent flexibility through its modular design: depending on the attached module, various parameters such as pH, conductivity, ion concentration, and redox can be measured simultaneously.\nLearn more about pH sensors\nLearn more about buffer and standard solutions\nThermal Analysis\nMETTLER TOLEDO Analytical Instruments is the technology leader in thermal analysis instrumentation. Its innovative product range includes Differential Scanning Calorimeters (DSC), Thermogravimetric Analyzers (TGA), Thermomechanical Analyzers (TMA), and Dynamic Mechanical Analyzers (DMA), along with a powerful and unmatched common Thermal Analysis software platform.\nLearn more about thermal analysis\nMelting Point and Dropping Point Determination\nRegarding accuracy, compliance with standards, and operational security, the Melting Point and Dropping Point Excellence instruments from Analytical Instruments set a global standard for the automatic determination of melting, dropping, and softening points. Innovative sample preparation tools and the video recording feature ensure that the entire analytical workflow is performed efficiently, reliably, and error-free.\nLearn more about melting point determination\nLearn more about dropping point determination\nDensity and Refractive Index\nThe days of manual determinations using pycnometers, hydrometers, and optical Abbe refractometers are over. Our digital instruments determine the refractive index and density simply, accurately, and simultaneously in a multiparameter system. Our analytical instruments are available for a wide range of applications, including Brix, HFCS, and alcohol content. They also measure Oechsle, Plato, API gravity, and many other concentrations.\nLearn more about density meters\nLearn more about refractometers\nUV/Vis Spectroscopy\nUV/VIS Excellence spectrophotometers combine outstanding optical performance based on FastTrack™ technology with an intuitive One Click™ user interface. Excellent performance and reliable results are verified with the CertiRef module, which automates performance verification following our GUVP™ (Good UV/VIS Practice) package. The optional LabX® PC software allows for quick and smooth spectroscopic workflows. A dedicated analytical instrument for micro-volume measurements in the ultraviolet-visible range, based on LockPath™ technology, is ideal for life science applications.\nLearn more about UV/Vis spectrophotometers\nProducts\nApplications\nPublications\nServices\nLabX Software\nThermal Analysis Excellence\nMaterials characterization with our comprehensive portfolio of instruments, powerful software and a wide selection of accessories and crucibles.\nLab pH Instruments\nElectrochemistry systems provide accurate measurements of pH, conductivity, ion, ORP, and dissolved oxygen for laboratory and field applications.\nTitration Solutions\nMETTLER TOLEDO's titration solutions boost lab throughput with automated titrators, Karl Fischer titrators, advanced sensors, software, and essential automation accessories.\nMelting Point Instruments​\nObtain fast and accurate results with our melting point apparatus.
