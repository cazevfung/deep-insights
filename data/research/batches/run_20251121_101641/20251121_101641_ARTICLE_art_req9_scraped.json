However, your balance or moisture\nanalyzer is a sophisticated piece of weighing equipment. Correct installation\nand configuration ensures your instrument performs as intended so that you\navoid weighing errors, rework, and waste as well as associated financial losses.\n\nMETTLER TOLEDO’s professional installation and qualification services help you to ensure your\ninstrument is in an optimum location, delivers accurate weight results and complies with\nyour internal and external regulations right from the start.\n\nYou benefit from:\n\n- Immediate deployment\n- Correct setup\n- Professional qualification\n- Initial user training\n- Audit-proof documentation\nError-Free Operation Audit-Proof Documentation Optimum Location\n\nHas staff been trained on the\nnew instrument?\n\nInitial user training is included\nso that operators are familiar\nwith how to use the new instru-\nment correctly. You get up and\nrunning faster and operational\nerrors are minimized.\n\nIs your instrument installed in\nthe optimum location?\n\nExternal influences such as\ndrafts, direct sunlight, or an\nunstable table can lead to drift\nand random errors. The con-\nsequences are inaccurate and\ninconsistent weighing results.\n\nHas your instrument been\n­professionally installed and\nqualified?\n\nIn addition to in-depth opera-\ntional testing and initial calibra-\ntion, we provide audit-proof\ndocumentation that complies\nwith regulations such as GMP,\nGLP, and ISO.\n\n---\n\nChoose the Installation Pac that fulfills your quality and regulatory requirements\n\nMETTLER TOLEDO offers three different installation and qualification packages called EQPac, IPac and StarterPac.

Do you know which routine tests and calibrations are necessary\nto mitigate risks and pass any audit?\n\nThe Accuracy Calibration Certificate (ACC) assesses balance performance by documenting\nmeasurement uncertainty in use. Various annexes are available as an interpretation of the\n­calibration results, each giving a clear pass / fail statement for certain tolerances applied.\n\nThe GWP ^®^ Certificate annex sets a new benchmark in weighing accuracy by linking the\nperformance of your balance to your specific process requirements. This annex documents that\nyour instrument is fit-for-purpose and can produce the accuracy required for your process.\n\nTo ensure ­ongoing accuracy and compliance, GWP ^®^ ­Verification provides you with a risk-based,\naudit-proof routine testing and calibration plan.\n\nGWP ^®^ Certificate\n\nIs the instrument fit-for-purpose?\n\nWith the GWP ^®^ Certificate we\ncan help you determine whether\nthe balance meets your require-\nments. This documents that the\nbalance is fit for purpose and\nused within the safe weighing\nrange.\n\nAccuracy Calibration Certificate\n\nHow does your balance ­perform\non-site?\n\nWith the Accuracy ­Calibration\nCertificate (ACC) we measure\nthe performance (­measurement\nuncertainty) of the instrument\nover the entire ­weighing range.\n\nGWP ^®^ Verification\n\nHow can you maintain ­accuracy\nover time?\n\nBased on a risk ­assessment,\nGWP ^®^ Verification helps you\n­establish a routine testing plan to\n­maintain consistent quality and\nreduce costs.

contains everything you need to limit the risk of working outside\nspecified process tolerances. Two test weights are carefully selected to\ncorrespond to 5 percent and 100 percent of your balance’s capacity – precisely\nwhat USP Chapter 41 recommends for balance testing.\n\nTailored to your specific requirements, the three sizes of\nCarePac weight sets enable you to test balances of up\nto 8 kilograms weighing capacity. CarePac weights are\n­specified to validate process tolerances up to 0.03 percent.\n\nAll CarePac sets are delivered with a calibration certificate\nand include tweezers, gloves and other accessories for\n­professional weight handling.\n\nWith just two carefully ­selected\nweights, a CarePac has every-\nthing you need for efficient routine\nbalance testing in accordance\nwith USP Chapter 41 and GWP ^®^ .\n\nAll CarePac sets have the option\nto add a third weight to accom-\nmodate individual testing require-\nments. The nominal value of the\nthird weight is between 1 miligram\nand 100 grams.\n\nEffortless Weight Selection Optional Third Weight\n\nSupplied as standard with each\nCarePac are ergonomic accesso-\nries such as tweezers or weight\nforks and a cleaning cloth. This\nallows professional weight han-\ndling and testing right from the\nfirst day without wasting time\nsearching for the right tools.\n\nAccessories Included\n\n---\n\nOIML\n\nNominal Values Class Material No.\n\n1. 1 g / 2 g E2 11123004\n2. 2 g / 5 g F1 305506481 g / 20 g F1 30550617\n2 g / 50 g F2 30550616\n5 g / 100 g F2 30550615\n10 g / 200 g F2 30550614\n20 g / 200 g F2 30550613\n20 g / 500 g F2 30550649\n50 g / 1,000 g F2 11123008\n100 g / 2,000 g F2 11123009\n200 g / 2,000 g F2 11123010\n200 g / 5,000 g F2 11123011\n\nThird Weight\n\nNominal Value OIML Class E2 ASTM Class 1\n1 mg 11123044 11123144\n2 mg 11123045 11123145\n5 mg 11123046 11123146\n10 mg 11123047 11123147\n20 mg 11123048 11123148\n50 mg 11123049 11123149\n100 mg 11123050 11123150\n200 mg 11123051 11123151\n500 mg 11123052 11123152\n1 g 11123053 11123153\n2 g 11123054 11123154\n5 g 11123055 11123155\n10 g 11123056 11123156\n20 g 11123057 11123157\n50 g 11123058 11123158\n100 g 11123059 11123159\nASTM\n\nNominal Values Class Material No.\n\n1. 1 g / 2 g 1 11123104\n2. 2 g / 5 g 1 111231051 g / 20 g 1 11123106\n2 g / 50 g 1 11123103\n5 g / 100 g 1 11123102\n10 g / 200 g 1 11123101\n20 g / 200 g 1 11123100\n20 g / 500 g 1 11123107\n50 g / 1,000 g 1 11123108\n100 g / 2,000 g 1 11123109\n200 g / 2,000 g 4 11123110\n200 g / 5,000 g 4 11123111\n\nOptional third weight for CarePac sets – fits perfectly\ninto your CarePac carrying case\n\n| |\n|--|\n| |\n| |\n\n| E2 |\n|----|\n| F1 |\n| F1 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n| F2 |\n\n| 11123044 |\n|----------|\n| 11123045 |\n| 11123046 |\n| 11123047 |\n| 11123048 |\n| 11123049 |\n| 11123050 |\n| 11123051 |\n| 11123052 |\n| 11123053 |\n| 11123054 |\n| 11123055 |\n| 11123056 |\n| 11123057 |\n| 11123058 |\n| 11123059 |\n\n| 1 |\n|---|\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 1 |\n| 4 |\n| 4 |\n\n---\n\n Test Weights\n Certificate Not Included\n\nAll weights are made of ­premium\nstainless steel to make them\ncorrosion resistant. Monobloc\nweights are designed for long-\nterm stability, and weights with\nan adjusting cavity simplify\nweight adjustment without the\nneed for specialized equipment.\n\nOur unique manufacturing pro-\ncess involves traditional me-\nchanical polishing, final stage\nelectrolytic polishing, fully auto-\nmated cleaning and final calibra-\ntion using state-of-the-art mass\ncomparators.\n\nDesign and Construction Expertly Crafted\n\nTo protect the integrity of the\nweight and ensure a long life-\ntime, all weights are supplied in\na robust, easy-to-clean ­plastic\ncontainer. Approved materials,\n­including foam inserts, make\nthem a durable solution.\n\nProtection and Longevity\n\nHigh quality stainless steel test weights provide the best way to verify balance\nand scale performance and prevent out-of-specification errors. Premium stainless\nsteel weights are corrosion resistant and provide long-term stability over their\nentire life span.\n\nUsing test weights without a calibration certificate may be acceptable in certain cases. However, test\nweights with a calibration certificate provide a more comprehensive option in case ­documentation\nshould ever be requested. Certification relates to verifying and documenting accuracy. Even if not\n­required by regulations, using test weights with a calibration certificate provides the reassurance that all\nyour weight measurements can be validated at any time. For example, working according to ISO 9001\nrequires documented metrological traceability, so test weights with a certificate are necessary.\n\n- OIML Classes E1, E2, F1, F2, M1 without a calibration

Performance\n\nNational metrology institutes (NMIs) strive for measurements with the smallest\nuncertainty. “E0” calibration weights, which have a higher accuracy than E1,\nenable the highest metrological performance when calibration mass standards.\n\nTo produce “E0” weights, METTLER TOLEDO hand selects the best E1 weights which are then\n­calibrated by an NMI with an uncertainty of 1/ 5*MPE (E1).

However, the manual process is\nchallenging when sampling air-sensitive reactions, reactions at elevated pressure,\nor heterogeneous mixtures. Poor sampling reproducibility and delays in quenching\ncan lead to variable results and analytical inaccuracies. EasySampler™ was\ndesigned to eliminate these challenges by providing an automated and robust\ninline method of taking representative samples from reactions.\n\nIt is labor intensive or impos-\nsible to sample reactions that\nare air- or moisture-sensitive,\nat ­elevated pressure or sub-\nambient temperature, or highly\ntoxic. EasySampler’s unique\nprobe enables sample ­capture\nand immediate quench so\nsamples are representative\nof the reaction at the time of\n­sampling.\n\nSampling reactions with preci­sion\nis challenging, especially for het-\nerogeneous or multiphase reac-\ntions. EasySampler samples from\nthe same position in the reactor\ninto a fixed-volume pocket. Solids\nbegin dissolving immediately in\nthe quench step for accurate and\nreproducible analytical data.\n\nSampling long reactions or\na series of DOE experiments\ncan be impractical. The lack\nof samples leads to blind spots\nin data, thus requiring repeat\nexperiments.
