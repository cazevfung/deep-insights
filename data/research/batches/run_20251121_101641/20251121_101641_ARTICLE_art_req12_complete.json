Group Basis\n\nThe Annual Report 2024 provides a detailed overview of the business activities, objectives and strategy of the\nSartorius Group. The statements made therein are still valid. There were no significant changes in the first half\nof 2025.\n\n Economic and Sector Report\n\nThe Sartorius Group is active in sectors that differ in their dependence on the economy. The Bioprocess\nSolutions Division, for instance, operates in an environment that is largely independent of economic\nfluctuations. The Lab Products & Services Division, in contrast, is partly active in sectors whose development is\nmore strongly affected by economic factors.\n\n Subdued economic momentum under the influence of political\n uncertainties\n\nEconomic sentiment has deteriorated noticeably since the start of 2025, particularly due to increasing\ngeopolitical tensions and growing uncertainty in connection with US customs policy. Against this backdrop,\nboth the IMF and the OECD have downgraded their growth forecasts for 2025. Despite risks, the global\neconomy proved robust overall in the first quarter of 2025 according to the latest OECD data. However, the\nregional picture was mixed.\n\nIn the European Union, gross domestic product (GDP) growth accelerated to 1.4% in the first quarter of 2025\n(prior-year period: +0.6%), although developments in the major eurozone countries varied. Economic output\nin Germany stagnated at the previous year's level (prior-year period: -0.1%) and growth momentum in France\nslowed to 0.6% (prior-year period: +1.7%). In contrast, the UK recorded a slight upturn and grew by 1.3% in the\nfirst quarter (prior-year period: +0.7%).\n\nIn the USA, economic growth slowed to 2.1% in the first quarter of 2025 (prior-year period: +2.9%).\n\nThe picture in the Asia-Pacific region was also mixed. At 5.4%, GDP growth in China was slightly higher than\nthe previous year's figure of 5.3%. Japan's economy recovered significantly and grew by 1.6% (prior-year period:\n-0.9%). In contrast, growth in India fell to 6.9% (prior-year period: +8.4%) and in South Korea into negative\nterritory at -0.3% (prior-year period: +3.1%).\n\nSources: OECD: Quarterly National Accounts, June 2025; IMF: World Economic Outlook, April 2025.\n\n Growth in the biopharmaceutical market\n\nThe global pharmaceutical market recorded sales growth of 6% in 2024. In particular, sales of\nbiopharmaceutical drugs, which are growing at an above-average rate within the market, increased\nsignificantly by around 9% to $458 billion. Biopharmaceutical products therefore accounted for 41% of the\noverall market (2023: 40%).\n\n---\n\nThe bioprocessing market, which comprises products for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals, gradually\nstabilized in 2024 following a period of pronounced volatility due to the pandemic. The positive development\nwas particularly evident in the consumables business, which benefited from the largely completed reduction\nof increased inventories on the customer side. By contrast, biopharmaceutical customers continued to hold\nback on investment decisions in new capacities, which affected demand for equipment and instruments.\n\nThe market recovery continued in all regions in the first quarter of 2025, with the leading manufacturers of\nbioprocessing technology recording substantial growth rates. This development continued to be driven by\nthe consumables business, while biopharmaceutical customers remained hesitant to invest.\n\nGrowth in the biopharmaceutical market is generally more dependent on medium and long-term trends than\non short-term economic fluctuations. Significant impetus comes from the increasing global demand for\nmedicines and the approval and market launch of innovative biopharmaceuticals. Other growth drivers are the\nexpansion of the indication areas of already approved medications and their increasing market penetration.\nThe number of new biopharmaceutical approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remained\nat a high level both in 2024 at 47 (2023: 41) and in the first half of 2025 at 18 (first half of 2024: 23).\n\n Temporary reluctance to invest in the laboratory market\n\nThe global laboratory market reached a volume of around $85 billion in 2024. Industry experts expect average\nannual growth of around 5% in the medium to long term. Market growth depends, among other things, on the\nresearch and development expenditure of the respective end markets, which is partly linked to economic\ndevelopment.\n\nHowever, this applies to a lesser extent to labs in the pharmaceutical and biopharma industries, the leading\ncustomer groups for laboratory instruments and consumables: In this industry, demand is more strongly\ninfluenced by fundamental growth drivers, such as continuous research to find new active pharmaceutical\ningredients. In addition, demand in the life science sector is generally growing faster than demand in other\nindustries.\n\nAfter high volatility in previous years due to the pandemic, the business situation in the laboratory market\ngradually stabilized again in 2024, but demand for laboratory instruments remained at a low level attributable\nto the continued reluctance of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical customers to invest. Business in China\nin particular continued to be heavily influenced by the general market weakness.\n\nThese factors also dampened business development in the first quarter of 2025, with the ongoing reluctance\nto invest being exacerbated by a deteriorating industry-specific and political environment, including a\nmoderate financing environment for biotech companies, discussions about lowering drug prices in the USA\nand planned spending cuts for the most important US federal agency for biomedical research. According to a\nnumber of leading suppliers of laboratory instruments and consumables, the latter contributed to a weakening\nof demand from academic and public research institutions, another important customer group in the\nlaboratory market.\n\nSources: Evaluate Pharma: World Preview 2024, August 2024; SDi: Global Assessment Report 2024, June 2024; own analysis of\n\ncompany data; www.fda.gov\n\n---\n\n Sartorius Shares\n\n Global Stock Markets\n\nThe global stock markets were volatile in the first half of 2025, but largely recorded price gains. In particular,\nthe changing news situation surrounding the introduction of import tariffs by the US government, trade policy\ncountermeasures and the associated macroeconomic implications influenced the performance of the major\nindices in both positive and negative directions.\n\nAmid these developments, the MSCI Europe ended the reporting period around 7.3% higher at 2,417 points.\nThe German benchmark index DAX and the technology index TecDAX, to which the Sartorius preference\nshares belong, recorded gains of 20.1% to 23,910 points and 13.5% to 3,877 points respectively. In contrast,\nsector-relevant benchmark indices such as the S&P 500 Life Sciences Tools and Services and the NASDAQ\nBiotechnology Index underperformed, falling by 17.7% to 751 points and 1.9% to 4,228 points respectively in the\nfirst half of 2025.\n\n Sartorius Shares\n\nDue to a number of industry-related developments, particularly in the US, investors were increasingly cautious\ntowards the life science sector in the first half of 2025. Dampening factors included the moderate financing\nenvironment for biotech companies, planned spending cuts for the most important US federal agency for\nbiomedical research and discussions about lowering drug prices. Although investor restraint also affected\nSartorius share prices, they performed significantly better given the company's strong performance in the first\nquarter 2025 and the positive outlook in the bioprocessing market. Against this backdrop, the Sartorius AG\npreference share was trading at €216.00 as of June 30, 2025, which corresponds to a slight increase of 0.4%\ncompared to the closing price at the end of 2024. The ordinary share closed at €176.60 at the end of the first\nhalf of the year, an increase of 2.4%. The Group's market capitalization based on outstanding ordinary and\npreference shares amounted to around €13.6 billion as of the reporting date (December 31, 2024: €13.4 billion).\n\nThe average number of preference shares traded daily on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra and floor\ntrading) was 116,911 in the first half of 2025, compared to 99,157 in the previous year. The average trading\nvolume in the first six months amounted to €3.3 billion (previous year: €3.9 billion).\n\nDue to the low free float, the ordinary share is only traded to a limited extent. The average number of shares\ntraded daily was 4,369 compared to 4,270 in the previous year. The corresponding trading volume in the first\nhalf of the year amounted to around €97.6 million (previous year: €126.9 million).\n\nThe Sartorius AG preference share is listed in the German DAX share index and also in the TecDAX. At the end\nof the first half of the year, the preference share ranked 48th in the DAX and 8th in the TecDAX in terms of free\nfloat market capitalization.\n\n---\n\nSource: NASDAQ\n\n Dividend\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of Sartorius AG was held on March 27, 2025, in virtual format without the physical\npresence of shareholders or their proxies. The payment of a dividend of €0.74 per preference share and €0.73\nper ordinary share was resolved.\n\n Analysts\n\nAs at the reporting date, 28 financial analysts were analyzing the Sartorius share. The average target price for\nthe preference share is €268.60.\n\nJanuary 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025\n\n**Sartorius Shares in Comparison to DAX and MSCI Europe Index (indexed)**\n\n\n-50\n\nPreference Share Ordinary Share\n\nJanuary June May April February\n\nDAX MSCI Europe Index\n\nMarch\n\n---\n\n Shareholder structure\n\nAccording to the information available to us, the shareholder structure remained unchanged in the first half of\n\n1.\n\nInformation on shareholdings and shares in free float pursuant to the disclosure requirements of Sections 33 et seq. of the German\n\nSecurities Trading Act (WpHG) and the shareholders’ own disclosures.

As expected, this\ngrowth was led by the high-margin recurring business with consumables, which accounts for a larger share of\ntotal Group sales revenue, while the industry-wide reluctance of customers to invest continued to influence\nthe business with laboratory instruments and bioprocess equipment.\n\n**Sales Revenue**\n\nin millions of € **6 months 2025** 6 months 2024 Δ in % reported\nΔ in % cc ^1^\n\nSales revenue 1,767.3 1,680.3 5.2 6.1\n\nEMEA ^2^\n\n1. 8 690.8 5.9 5.9\nAmericas ^2^\n\n1. 4 602.7 5.9 7.1\nAsia | Pacific ^2^\n\n1. 1 386.8 2.7 5.0\n1 Figures given in constant currencies eliminate the impact of changes in exchange rates by applying the same exchange rate for the\n\ncurrent and the previous period.\n\n2 According to customers' location\n\nAll business regions contributed to revenue growth. In the EMEA region, which accounted for around 41% of\ntotal Group revenue, sales rose by 5.9% to €731.8 million. Business in the Americas region, which accounted\nfor around 36% of Group revenue, grew by 7.1% to €638.4 million in the reporting period. Revenue in the\nAsia | Pacific region was €397.1 million, up 5.0%. This region accounted for around 23% of total Group sales. (All\ngrowth rates for regional development are in constant currencies unless otherwise stated.)\n\n Overproportionate increase in underlying earnings\n\nThe Sartorius Group uses underlying EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\nand adjusted for extraordinary items) as its key profitability indicator.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, underlying EBITDA rose significantly by 11.9% to €527.3 million, mainly due to volume\nand product mix effects as well as economies of scale. The corresponding margin increased by 1.7 percentage\npoints to 29.8%.\n\n| Sales Revenue | | | | |\n|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|------------|\n| in millions of € | 6 months 2025 | 6 months 2024 | Δ in % reported | Δ in % cc1 |\n| Sales revenue | 1,767.3 | 1,680.3 | 5.2 | 6.1 |\n| EMEA2 | 731.8 | 690.8 | 5.9 | 5.9 |\n| Americas2 | 638.4 | 602.7 | 5.9 | 7.1 |\n| Asia | Pacific2 | 397.1 | 386.8 | 2.7 | 5.0 |\n\n---\n\n**Reconciliation from EBIT to Underlying EBITDA**\n\n€ in millions **6 months 2025** 6 months 2024\n\nEBIT 269.3 229.0\n\nExtraordinary items 52.0 47.0\n\nDepreciation and amortization 206.0 195.5\n\n**Underlying EBITDA** **527.3** **471.4**\n\n**Extraordinary items**\n\n€ in millions **6 months 2025** 6 months 2024\n\nEfficiency measures –45.2 –40.4\n\nM&A projects | integration costs\n–6.1 –3.2\n\nOther –0.7 –3.3\n\n**Total** **–52.0** **–47.0**\n\nConsolidated earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) increased by 17.6% to €269.3 million (H1 2024:\n€229.0 million) as a result of higher gross profit and only a moderate rise in expenses in the functional areas. In\naddition to depreciation and amortization, this figure includes extraordinary items of -€52.0 million (H1 2024:\n-€47.0 million). These extraordinary items resulted primarily from expenses for various corporate projects and\nefficiency measures or in connection with the latest acquisitions. The EBIT margin rose to 15.2% (H1 2024:\n\n1. 6%).\nThe financial result amounted to -€99.0 million in the first half of 2025, compared with -€103.0 million in the\nprevious year. The decline was mainly due to lower interest expense.\n\nNet profit for the first six months of 2025 increased by 34.9% to €124.4 million (H1 2024: €92.2 million). The\nGroup´s net profit after non-controlling interest amounted to €81.0 million, compared with €60.9 million\nin the same period of the previous year, with non-controlling interests accounting for €43.4 million\n(H1 2024: €31.3 million). A tax rate of 27% expected for the full year was applied for calculating tax expenses\n(H1 2024: 27%).\n\n| Reconciliation from EBIT to Underlying EBITDA | | |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| € in millions | 6 months 2025 | 6 months 2024 |\n| EBIT | 269.3 | 229.0 |\n| Extraordinary items | 52.0 | 47.0 |\n| Depreciation and amortization | 206.0 | 195.5 |\n| Underlying EBITDA | 527.3 | 471.4 |\n\n| Extraordinary items | | |\n|----------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| € in millions | 6 months 2025 | 6 months 2024 |\n| Efficiency measures | –45.2 | –40.4 |\n| M&A projects | integration costs | –6.1 | –3.2 |\n| Other | –0.7 | –3.3 |\n| Total | –52.0 | –47.0 |\n\n---\n\n Underlying net result\n\nThe underlying net result attributable to the shareholders of Sartorius AG rose by 13.7% from €148.4 million to\n€168.7 million. This figure is calculated by adjusting for extraordinary items and eliminating amortization and is\nbased on the normalized financial result and the normalized tax rate.

Positive effects from the higher operating income and lower tax payments were\noffset by the growth-related increase in working capital to ensure delivery capability. The previous year's figure\nwas also positively influenced by the significant reduction in inventory levels that were elevated due to the\npandemic.\n\nBased on fundamentally intact growth drivers in the end markets and its medium-term growth targets,\nSartorius continued its multiyear investment program and made progress during the reporting period,\nincluding the completion of capacity expansion at the site in Aubagne, France. Cash outflow from investing\nactivities was, as planned, disproportionately low in the first half of 2025 and decreased by 29.9% to\n€167.5 million. The ratio of capital expenditures (capex) to sales in the first half of 2025 was 9.1%, compared to\n\n1. 6%, in the prior-year period. The purchase price payment associated with the completion of the acquisitionof MatTek Corporation announced in April 2025 was made after the balance sheet date on July 1, 2025.\n\n Key balance sheet and financial indicators remain robust\n\nThe balance sheet total of Sartorius Group as of June 30, 2025, amounted to €10,027.2 million which was\n€75.8 million lower than the figure reported as of December 31, 2024. The decline is attributable, among other\nthings, to the reduction in non-current assets by €129.1 million to €7,860.2 million, mainly due to currency\neffects and scheduled depreciation and amortization. These factors also had a reducing effect on property,\nplant, and equipment, which nevertheless remained above the value as of December 31, 2024, attributable to\nthe continuation of the multiyear investment program.\n\n| in millions of € | 6 months 2025 | 6 months 2024 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| EBIT | 269.3 | 229.0 |\n| Extraordinary items | 52.0 | 47.0 |\n| Amortization | 78.7 | 79.9 |\n| Normalized financial result1 | –80.6 | –85.9 |\n| Normalized income tax2 | –86.2 | –72.9 |\n| Underlying net result after tax | 233.2 | 197.1 |\n| Non-controlling interest | –64.5 | –48.7 |\n| Underlying earnings after taxes and non-controlling interest | 168.7 | 148.4 |\n| Underlying earnings per share | | |\n| per ordinary share in € | 2.44 | 2.15 |\n| per preference share in € | 2.45 | 2.16 |\n\n---\n\nCurrent assets increased by €53.3 million to €2,167.0 million, partly driven by the growth-related increase in\nworking capital ^1^ to €1,110.7 million as of June 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024: €1,106.4 million). The reporting-\ndate valuation of foreign currency derivatives also had an increasing effect.\n\nThe Sartorius Group’s equity amounted to €3,794.4 million at the end of the reporting period (December 31,\n2024: €3,897.8 million), and the equity ratio remained at a solid level of 37.8% (December 31, 2024: 38.6%).\n\nGross debt, comprising bonds, promissory note loans (“Schuldscheindarlehen”), bilateral loans and lease\nliabilities, rose slightly by €95.6 million to €4,655.4 million as of June 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024:\n€4,559.8 million). Net debt, defined as gross debt less cash and cash equivalents, amounted to\n€3,836.4 million (December 31, 2024: €3,746.4 million). The increase in gross and net debt compared with the\nend of 2024 is mainly attributable to higher lease liabilities and interest accruals for interest payable in\nSeptember from bond financing.\n\nThe ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA was further reduced as planned to 3.8 as of June 30, 2025\n(December 31, 2024: 4.0). This ratio is calculated as the quotient of net debt and underlying EBITDA over the\npast 12 months, including the pro forma amount contributed by acquisitions for this period.\n\n1 Working Capital = Sum of inventories and trade receivables.\n\n---\n\n Slight increase in number of employees\n\nThe number of employees as of June 30, 2025, increased slightly to 13,685, mainly due to additional hiring in\nproduction, and was thus 157 higher than the figure of 13,528 employees at the end of 2024. The number of\nemployees in EMEA rose by about 2.1% to 9,193 in the first half of 2025 compared with the end of December\n\n1. At the end of June, Sartorius employed 2,461 people in the Americas, representing a decline of 2.0%,while the number in the Asia-Pacific region rose by 0.8% to 2,031 employees.\n\n---\n\n Business Development of the Divisions\n\n Bioprocess Solutions with significant growth in sales and earnings\n\nThe Bioprocess Solutions division, which offers a wide range of innovative technologies for the efficient and\nsustainable production of biopharmaceuticals, continued its upward trend and recorded a significant increase\nin sales revenue of 8.8% in constant currencies to €1,434.9 million (reported: 7.8%) in the first half of 2025. The\nvery positive development in the high-margin consumables business was a key factor, while the industry-wide\nreluctance of customers to invest continued to impact the equipment and systems business as expected.\n\nSales revenue in this division rose in all regions in the first half of the year. Business in EMEA grew by 9.4%. In\nthe Americas and Asia-Pacific, business momentum also picked up compared with the previous year, with\nsales increasing by 8.9% and 7.5%, respectively.

For this reason, please refer\nto a detailed description of the opportunities and risks as well as the risk management system for the Sartorius\nGroup on pages 73 et seq. of the 2025 Annual Report.\n\nIn the first half of 2025, the U.S. government introduced additional tariffs on imports from various countries.\nThe 10% tariffs on imports from the EU, which have been in effect since April, are particularly relevant for\nSartorius. At the time of reporting, a further increase to 30% had been announced for August 1. The impact of\nthe tariffs on Sartorius’ net assets, financial position, and earnings is limited overall and will be mitigated by\nvarious compensatory and corrective measures. For example, the additional expenses are currently being\npassed on to customers for a large part of the deliveries affected by the increased tariffs. In addition, Sartorius\nmanufactures a significant proportion of the products sold in the U.S. locally and can further increase the share\nof local value added if necessary.\n\nThe US tariffs on imports from China do not significantly affect Sartorius due to the marginal imports from this\nregion.\n\nUncertainty remains significantly elevated due to continued volatility and the unpredictability of further\ndecisions by the U.S. government, as well as possible counter-reactions from its trading partners. The Group\nis continuously monitoring current developments and, against this backdrop, has intensively examined its\nsupply chains, production sites and value streams in order to best position itself for potentially permanently\nincreased tariffs. As a group headquartered in Germany, Sartorius does not see itself at a disadvantage in the\ncompetitive environment due to the regulated market environment in biopharmaceuticals and the global\nsupply chains that are standard in the industry.\n\n---\n\n Forecast Report\n\n Macroeconomic outlook\n\nIn light of increasing trade barriers, particularly as a result of the US government's tariff policy and the\nassociated countermeasures, the outlook for global economic growth has deteriorated since the start of the\nyear. The IMF and other economic research institutes have downgraded their initial economic forecasts for\n2025, in some cases significantly, due to the deterioration in conditions. The expansion of the global economy\nis therefore likely to slow to 2.8%, a below-average pace by historical standards (2024: +3.3%). The IMF expects\ngrowth to slow to 1.4% for industrialized countries (2024: +1.8%) and to 3.7% for emerging and developing\ncountries (2024: +4.3%).\n\nFor the European Union, the IMF forecasts GDP growth of 1.2% in 2025 (2024: +1.1%). Stagnation is expected\nfor Germany (2024: -0.2%). France and the United Kingdom, two key markets for Sartorius, are expected to\ngrow by 0.6% (2024: +1.1%) and 1.1% (2024: +1.1%), respectively.\n\nIn the USA, growth of 1.8% is expected for 2025 (2024: +2.8%). In the Asia-Pacific region, the IMF forecasts\ngrowth of 3.9% (2024: +4.6%). The Chinese economy is likely to expand by 4.0% (2024: +5.0%), while India will\ncontinue to show strong momentum at 6.2% (2024: +6.5%). The economies of South Korea and Japan, also\nimportant markets for Sartorius, are expected to grow by 1.0% (2024: 2.0%) and 0.6% (2024: +0.1%)\nrespectively.\n\nSources: International Monetary Fund, World Economic Outlook Update, April 2025.\n\n Industry-specific environment\n\nThe trends described on pages 87 to 90 of the Annual Report 2024, which influence the development of the\nSartorius Group, continue to apply overall.\n\nGrowth in the pharmaceutical industry is based on strong long-term trends and largely independent of\nbusiness cycles. According to IQVIA estimates, the global pharmaceutical market is expected to grow by 5%\nto 8% annually until 2029. Within the pharmaceutical market, the biopharma segment has been developing\nparticularly strongly for years and will continue to outperform the market according to various forecasts.\nAverage annual growth is expected to be around 10% in the coming years. A market volume of around\n$680 billion is forecast for 2028, which means that the share of biological medications and vaccines as a\npercentage of total revenue in the global pharmaceutical market could rise from the current 41% to 45%.\n\nThe leading manufacturers of bioprocessing technology expect the positive momentum seen at the start of\nthe year to continue in 2025, contributing to robust sales growth. The key driver of business development is\nthe significantly expanding business with consumables. Despite a visible upturn in customer activity, market\nparticipants remain cautious in their expectations for the equipment business in 2025. In the foreseeable\nfuture, however, the associated demand should once again benefit from the strong underlying demand drivers\nin the biopharmaceutical market and rising production volumes.\n\nAccording to various market observers, the market for laboratory instruments and consumables is expected\nto grow by around 5% annually in the coming years and reach a volume of around $104 billion in 2028.\nHowever, leading suppliers of laboratory products predict that industry growth in 2025 will likely remain below\nthis level due to the continued reluctance of pharmaceutical customers to invest, as well as subdued demand\nfrom academic and public research institutions. Nevertheless, the market should continue to recover\n\n---\n\ncompared to previous years, growing slightly overall. In terms of end markets, the pharmaceutical and\nbiopharmaceutical industries are likely to continue to be the main drivers of demand in the medium term. The\nbasis for this is the continuous research and approval of new drugs and the high level of scientific and\ntechnological innovation.\n\nEvaluatePharma expects sector-specific research expenditure to increase by 3.3% annually to $348 billion\nbetween 2024 and 2028.\n\nSources: IQVIA: The Global Use of Medicines Outlook through 2029, June 2025; Evaluate Pharma: World Preview 2024, August\n\n2024; 2024; SDi: Global Assessment Report 2024, June 2024; own evaluation of company data\n\n Outlook for 2025 confirmed\n\nBased on the results of the first half of the year and the expected continued positive market development,\nmanagement confirms its outlook for the full year 2025 published in April 2025 and anticipates organic sales\nrevenue growth of approximately 6% for the Group (2024: +0.1% in constant currencies), around 7% in the\nBioprocess Solutions Division (2024: +0.9% in constant currencies), and around 1% in Lab Products & Services\n(2024: -3.0% in constant currencies), with a bandwidth of around plus/minus two percentage points due to\nthe continuing above-average volatility.\n\nIn terms of earnings, the company expects an underlying EBITDA margin at Group level of around 29 to 30%\n(2024: 28.0%), with the margin in the Bioprocess Solutions Division rising to around 31 to 32% (2024: 29.3%)\nand the margin of the lab division is expected to reach around 22 to 23% (2024: 22.9%). The sales and margin\nforecast does not include possible effects of tariffs or related mitigating and corrective measures, which,\ndepending on their design, scope, and duration, could impact sales revenue- and margin development\ntemporarily to a certain extent. Management does not expect any influence on the strong market position and\ncompetitiveness of Sartorius.\n\nThe ratio of capital expenditures (capex) to sales revenue is expected to remain at the previous year's level of\nabout 12.5% (2024: 12.1%), and the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA is expected to decrease to about 3.5\n(2024: 4.0).\n\n**Comparison with the forecast from January 2025**\nAt the beginning of the year, the Sartorius Group published qualitative statements regarding its expectations\nfor fiscal 2025. According to these statements, Group management anticipated a continuous demand\nrecovery and growth in the life science market, albeit at a rate that is still below its long-term average. In this\nenvironment, Sartorius aimed to grow profitably above market level and to achieve a moderate increase in\nsales revenue, which was expected to be driven primarily by recurring business with consumables. Due to the\nvarying dynamics in their respective submarkets, the Bioprocess Solutions Division was expected to contribute\nmore strongly to growth than the Lab Products & Services Division. Based on the expected volume\ndevelopment positive product mix effects and supported by the effects of the previous year’s efficiency\nprogram, the company also forecast that underlying EBITDA, should increase over-proportionately compared\nto sales revenue. In its January forecast, Group management also announced that it would continue its organic\ndebt reduction course with a focus on working capital and managing investments, and expected the leverage\nratio to decrease noticeably. The ratio of capital expenditures (capex) to sales revenue should be roughly the\nsame as in the previous year.\n\n---\n\n# Condensed Interim Financial Statements\n\n Statement of Profit or Loss\n\n€

General Information\n\nSartorius AG is a listed joint stock corporation established according to German law and is the highest level\nparent company of the Sartorius Group. The corporation is recorded in the German Commercial Register of\nthe District Court of Göttingen (HRB 1970) and is headquartered at Otto-Brenner-Str. 20 in Göttingen,\nFederal Republic of Germany.\n\nThe Sartorius Group is a leading international partner to life sciences research and the biopharmaceutical\nindustry. With innovative laboratory instruments and consumables, the Group’s Lab Products & Services\nDivision (LPS) focuses on laboratories performing research and quality control at pharmaceutical and\nbiopharmaceutical companies as well as academic research institutes. The Bioprocess Solutions Division\n(BPS), with its broad product portfolio focusing on single-use solutions, helps customers manufacture biotech\nmedications, vaccines, and cell and gene therapeutics more safely, rapidly, and sustainably.\n\n 2.  Accounting Policies\n\nThe consolidated annual financial statements of Sartorius AG for the period ended December 31, 2024, were\nprepared in accordance with the accounting standards of the International Accounting Standards Board\n(IASB) – the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) – as they are to be applied in the EU. In the\npresent interim condensed financial statements that were prepared in conformance with the requirements of\nIAS 34 “Interim Financial Reporting”, basically the same accounting and measurement principles were applied\non which the past consolidated financial statements of fiscal 2024 were based with the exception of those\nprinciples that were effective in the current reporting period for the first time.\n\nFurthermore, all interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee\n(IFRS IC) to be applied effective June 30, 2025, were observed. An explanation of the individual accounting\nand measurement principles applied is provided in the Notes to the Financial Statements of the Group for the\nyear ended December 31, 2024. The standards applied for the first time and the amended material accounting\npolicies are explained in Section 3 below.\n\nFor calculation of income tax expenses, the provisions of IAS 34.30(c) were applied in the interim consolidated\nfinancial statements; i.e., the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the\nfull financial year was generally applied (27%; H1 2024: 27%).\n\n 3.  Accounting Rules Applied for the First Time in the Current Fiscal Year\n\n**Standards to Be Applied for the First Time in 2025**\nThe Group applied the following new or amended accounting rules for the first time in the reporting period:\n\n Amendments to IAS 21 – Lack of Exchangeability\n\nThe amendments specify when a currency is exchangeable for another currency and when it is not.\nFurthermore, they describe how the applicable exchange rate is to be determined if a currency has been\nidentified as non-exchangeable. The amendments also include disclosure requirements in the event that a\ncurrency is deemed non-exchangeable.\n\n---\n\nThe application of the new rules did not have an impact on the consolidated interim financial statements.\n\n 4.  Use of Judgments and Estimates\n\nIn preparing these interim financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and\nassumptions based on the conditions and expectations as of the reporting date. Actual results may differ from\nthese estimates, however. The significant judgments and estimates have remained largely unchanged\ncompared to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. Management has\nobserved, however, that the general uncertainty inherent in accounting estimates and assumptions remains\nhigher than in pre-Covid-19 times, not least due to geopolitical developments such as ongoing conflicts\nbetween Russia and Ukraine or in the Middle East, as well as increased volatility due to increasing trade\ntensions between the United States and several leading economies. With regard to the above-mentioned\nmilitary conflicts, there have been no significant changes for the Group since the 2024 consolidated financial\nstatements. The customs policy of the United States, which is the cause of the trade tensions, and the possible\neffects on the Group are described in the risk report. The current impact on the net assets, financial position\nand earnings is limited. For the business development of the Group and the divisions in the first half of 2025,\nreference is made to the Group interim management report.\n\n 5.  Segment Report\n\nAccording to IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the identification of reportable operating segments is based on the\n“management approach”; i.e., the segments are defined analogously to the internal control and reporting\nstructure of an entity. Accordingly, the Bioprocess Solutions and Lab Products & Services divisions are to be\nconsidered operating segments.\n\n“Underlying EBITDA” is the key performance indicator of the operating segments of the Sartorius Group.\nEBITDA corresponds to earnings before interest (financial result), taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n“Underlying EBITDA” means EBITDA adjusted for extraordinary items. Extraordinary items are expenses and\nincome in connection with efficiency measures (e.g., restructuring activities, and large Group projects, such as\nIT projects), acquisitions, and other gains or losses that distort the sustainable profitability of a segment.\n\nApart from that, the recognition and measurement methods for the reportable segments conform to the\ngeneral Group accounting principles.\n\n---\n\nBioprocess Solutions\nLab Products & Services\nReconciliation* Group\n\n€ in millions\n\n**6 months**\n\n**2025**\n\n6 months\n\n\n**6 months**\n\n**2025**\n\n6 months\n\n\n**6 months**\n\n**2025**\n\n6 months\n\n\n**6 months**\n\n**2025**\n\n6 months\n\n\nSales revenue 1,434.9 1,331.1 332.4 349.2 1,767.3 1,680.3\n\nCost of sales –696.1 –658.2 –157.2 –159.9 –66.8 –77.5 –920.1 –895.5\n\nSelling and distribution\ncosts –230.8 –227.5 –79.3 –83.0 –23.5 –25.4 –333.6 –335.9\n\nResearch and development\nexpenses –67.1 –67.5 –22.1 –22.0 –2.3 –1.1 –91.4 –90.6\n\nUnderlying EBITDA 453.3 389.0 74.0 82.4 527.3 471.4\n\nDepreciation and\namortization –206.0 –195.5\n\nExtraordinary items –52.0 –47.0\n\n**Earnings before interest**\n**and taxes (EBIT)** **269.3** **229.0**\n\nFinancial result –99.0 –103.0\n\n**Profit before tax** **170.4** **126.0**\n\n* Functional costs are monitored by the chief operating decision maker (Executive Board of Sartorius AG) primarily excluding\n\namortization of intangible assets from purchase price allocations as well as extraordinary income and expenses.\n\nThe extraordinary items are as follows:\n\n€ in millions\n\n**6 months**\n\n**2025**\n\n6 months\n\n\nEfficiency measures –45.2 –40.4\n\nM&A projects | integration costs\n–6.1 –3.2\n\nOther –0.7 –3.3\n\n**Total** **–52.0** **–47.0**\n\n 6.  Disaggregation of Revenue\n\nRevenue is recognized according to IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is\ndisaggregated into the categories “nature of products” and “geographical regions” as well as according to\n“type of revenue” (recurring/non-recurring) as shown in the following table. Categorization by “nature of\nproducts” corresponds to the reportable segments, as the identification of the reportable segments is based\nin particular on the different products sold. Regional disaggregation of revenue is based on the customers’\nlocation. The Group defines recurring revenue as revenue from consumables and services, while non-\nrecurring revenue is primarily defined as instrument revenue.\n\n6 months\n\n\n6 months\n\n\n€ in millions **Group**\n\nBioprocess\n\nSolutions\n\nLab Products\n\n& Services\n**Group**\n\nBioprocess\n\nSolutions\n\nLab Products\n\n& Services\n\n**Sales revenue** **1,767.3** **1,434.9** **332.4** **1,680.3** **1,331.1** **349.2**\n\nEMEA 731.8 601.6 130.2 690.8 550.1 140.7\n\nAmericas 638.4 529.3 109.1 602.7 491.4 111.3\n\nAsia | Pacific\n\n1. 1 304.0 93.2 386.8 289.6 97.2\n\n| | Bioprocess Solutions | | Lab Products & Services | | Reconciliation* | | Group | |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|----------|-------------------------|----------|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| € in millions | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months | 6 months |\n| | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 |\n| Sales revenue | 1,434.9 | 1,331.1 | 332.4 | 349.2 | | | 1,767.3 | 1,680.3 |\n| Cost of sales | –696.1 | –658.2 | –157.2 | –159.9 | –66.8 | –77.5 | –920.1 | –895.5 |\n| Selling and distribution | –230.8 | –227.5 | –79.3 | –83.0 | –23.5 | –25.4 | –333.6 | –335.9 |\n| costs | | | | | | | | |\n| Research and development | –67.1 | –67.5 | –22.1 | –22.0 | –2.3 | –1.1 | –91.4 | –90.6 |\n| expenses | | | | | | | | |\n\n| Underlying EBITDA | 453.3 | 389.0 | 74.0 | 82.4 | | | 527.3 | 471.4 |\n|--------------------------|-------|-------|------|------|--|--|--------|--------|\n| Depreciation and | | | | | | | –206.0 | –195.5 |\n| amortization | | | | | | | | |\n| Extraordinary items | | | | | | | –52.0 | –47.0 |\n| Earnings before interest | | | | | | | 269.3 | 229.0 |\n| and taxes (EBIT) | | | | | | | | |\n| Financial result | | | | | | | –99.0 | –103.0 |\n| Profit before tax | | | | | | | 170.4 | 126.0 |\n\n| € in millions | 6 months | 6 months |\n|----------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| | 2025 | 2024 |\n| Efficiency measures | –45.2 | –40.4 |\n| M&A projects | integration costs | –6.1 | –3.2 |\n| Other | –0.7 | –3.3 |\n| Total | –52.0 | –47.0 |\n\n| | 6 months | | | 6 months | | |\n|----------------|----------|------------|--------------|----------|------------|--------------|\n| | 2025 | | | 2024 | | |\n| € in millions | Group | Bioprocess | Lab Products | Group | Bioprocess | Lab Products |\n| | | Solutions | & Services | | Solutions | & Services |\n| Sales revenue | 1,767.3 | 1,434.9 | 332.4 | 1,680.3 | 1,331.1 | 349.2 |\n| EMEA | 731.8 | 601.6 | 130.2 | 690.8 | 550.1 | 140.7 |\n| Americas | 638.4 | 529.3 | 109.1 | 602.7 | 491.4 | 111.3 |\n| Asia | Pacific | 397.1 | 304.0 | 93.2 | 386.8 | 289.6 | 97.2 |\n\n---\n\n6 months\n\n\n6 months\n\n\n€ in millions **Group**\n\nBioprocess\n\nSolutions\n\nLab Products\n\n& Services\n**Group**\n\nBioprocess\n\nSolutions\n\nLab Products\n\n& Services\n\n**Sales revenue** **1,767.3** **1,434.9** **332.4** **1,680.3** **1,331.1** **349.2**\n\nRecurring sales revenue 1,402.4 1,219.6 182.8 1,214.6 1,043.9 170.7\n\nNon-recurring sales revenue 364.9 215.3 149.6 465.7 287.2 178.5\n\n 7.

In Level 2, financial instruments are measured on the basis of input factors, which are derivable\nfrom observable market data or on the basis of market prices for similar instruments. Level 3 financial\ninstruments are measured on the basis of input factors that cannot be derived from observable market data.\n\nThe financial instruments measured at fair value as of the reporting date include especially trade receivables\nthat are part of a portfolio that is “held-to-collect-and-sell” because of the factoring program. These trade\nreceivables are valued in the same way as trade receivables measured at amortized cost due to their short\ncontractual maturities and immaterial credit risks. In addition, as of June 30, 2025, there are derivatives in the\nform of forward contracts. The derivatives were measured on the basis of their quoted exchange rates and\nmarket yield curves (Level 2).\n\nThe valuation of the investment in BICO Group AB, which is measured at fair value through other\ncomprehensive income, is based on the current share price on the reporting date (Level 1). The fair value of\nthe investment amounted to €22.9 million as of the reporting date. The change in value since December 31,\n2024, recognized in other comprehensive income, amounts to €3.0 million.\n\nThe remaining financial investments measured at fair value are measured on the basis of the most recent\nreliable indicators available as of the reporting date, e.g., on the basis of the most recent financing round,\nupdated investor information or the historical cost of acquisition (Level 3). No material changes to the fair\nvalues were recognized as of the reporting date.\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value generally also include contingent consideration classified as\nfinancial liabilities in connection with the acquisitions of BIA Separations and Xell (Level 3). As of the reporting\ndate June 30, 2025, neither contingent consideration is attributed a material value. Each of the changes in\ncarrying amounts since December 31, 2024 were immaterial. Realistic changes to the underlying assumptions\nwill not lead to future payouts.\n\nFor the bonds issued in 2023, the respective market prices on the reporting date are used as an indicator of\nfair value (Level 1). The carrying amounts of these financial liabilities amounted to €3,088.8 million as of\nJune 30, 2025 (December 31, 2024: €3,019.6 million) and the fair value was €3,249.8 million (December 31,\n\n| € in millions | Category acc. to | Carrying amount | Fair value | Carrying amount | Fair value |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| | IFRS 9 | June 30, 2025 | June 30, 2025 | Dec. 31, 2024 | Dec. 31, 2024 |\n| Loans and borrowings | Financial liabilities | 4,447.2 | 4,585.2 | 4,378.6 | 4,514.5 |\n| | at cost | | | | |\n| Trade payables | Financial liabilities | 384.2 | 384.2 | 344.1 | 344.1 |\n| | at cost | | | | |\n| Derivative financial instruments | n/a | 0.7 | 0.7 | 17.0 | 17.0 |\n| in hedge relationships1 | | | | | |\n| Other financial liabilities | Financial liabilities | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.2 | 0.2 |\n| | at fair value | | | | |\n| | through profit or | | | | |\n| | loss | | | | |\n| Other financial liabilities | Financial liabilities | 156.8 | 154.8 | 172.5 | 168.9 |\n| | at cost | | | | |\n| Other financial liabilities | | 157.5 | 155.5 | 189.6 | 186.0 |\n\n---\n\n2024: €3,196.1 million). The fair values disclosed for the remaining financial liabilities recognized at amortized\ncost, especially liabilities to banks and those related to note loans (“Schuldscheindarlehen”), were measured\non the basis of the yield curve, taking the current (indicative) credit spreads into account (Level 2).\n\nThe liabilities for the acquisition of non-controlling interests in Sartorius Automated Lab Solutions GmbH and\nSartorius CellGenix GmbH, which are reported under “Other financial liabilities at cost”, are measured using\nthe effective interest rate method, with any changes recognized directly in equity. Since the respective\npurchase prices depend on the sales revenues achieved, the fair value measurement is to be allocated to\nLevel 3. The liability for the acquisition of the remaining 24% of the shares in Sartorius CellGenix GmbH\namounts to €76.2 million as of the reporting date (December 31, 2024: €79.5 million). Assuming 10% higher\n(lower) sales revenues in 2025 would result in an increase in the liability to be reported at the reporting date of\napproximately €2.9 million (decrease of approximately €2.9 million). The liability for the acquisition of\napproximately 37.5% of the shares in Sartorius Automated Lab Solutions GmbH was measured at €14.0 million\nas of the reporting date (December 31, 2024: €14.1 million). Realistic changes to the underlying assumptions\ndo not lead to a change in the carrying amount as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe fair values of the remaining financial assets and liabilities to be disclosed approximate the carrying\namounts on account of their predominantly short-term maturity or unchanged cost of acquisition. The\nmaximum credit loss risk is reflected by the carrying amounts of the financial assets recognized in the\nstatement of financial position.\n\nThe Group recognizes transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchies at the end of the reporting\nperiod during which a change occurs. In the current reporting period, there were no transfers between the\nlevels.\n\n 9.  Related Companies and Persons\n\nThe Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements carry out business activities and\ntransactions in related party relationships as defined by IAS 24. Among others, this concerns transactions with\nnon-consolidated subsidiaries; these transactions are generally concluded at customary market terms.\n\nAs in the prior-year comparative period, no material sales revenues were generated by sales to these\ncompanies in the current reporting period; there were receivables from loans totaling €6.7 million (December\n31, 2024: €14.815,9 million). A long-term service contract exists with a related entity for which expenses of\n€8.1 million (H1 2024: €6.7 million) were incurred in the reporting period.\n\nFor further details, also on related persons, see page 324 in the 2024 Annual Report.\n\n 10.  Other Disclosures\n\nAsset impairment tests need to be performed annually for goodwill and other assets with indefinite useful lives.\nIn addition, impairment tests need to be conducted on the reporting date when indicators are observed that\nnon-current assets may be impaired. Based on the analyses of the Group, no material impairments of assets\nwere to be recognized as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe Group is subject to legal proceedings, quality claims, taxes, customs, employee-related and other disputes\narising in the ordinary course of business. Group Management does not expect that the ultimate costs\nrequired to settle these matters will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s consolidated financial\nposition, statement of profit or loss or cash flows.\n\n---\n\nIn the reporting period, the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of Sartorius AG approved dividends totalling\n€50.7 million, of which €25.0 million are for ordinary shares and €25.8 million for preference shares. The\ndividend was paid in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group were authorized for issue by the Executive\nBoard on July 21, 2025. Independent certified auditors performed an audit review of this consolidated six-\nmonth report. The figures of the individual second quarter in the statement of profit or loss were not part of\nthis review, nor was the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n 11.  Material Events After the Reporting Date\n\n**Acquisition of MatTek**\nOn July 1, 2025, the Group acquired 100% of the shares and voting rights in MatTek Corporation and two\nsubsidiaries. MatTek is a leading developer and manufacturer of microtissues and 3D models. Founded in\n1985, the company employs more than 80 people at its headquarters in Ashland, Massachusetts, in the United\nStates and at its manufacturing site in Bratislava, Slovakia. The purchase price of around €69.8 million was paid\nin cash. Acquisition-related costs of around €1.2 million were recognized in other operating expenses in the\nfirst half of 2025. At the date of authorization of the interim financial statements, there was no preliminary\npurchase price allocation due to the temporal proximity to the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation\nis expected to result in the recognition of material intangible assets, in particular technologies, as well as\nmaterial goodwill. The tax deductibility of goodwill has not yet been assessed.\n\nMatTek’s portfolio of 3D models, microtissues and primary cells is designed to significantly accelerate drug\ndevelopment. The three-dimensional tissue models closely mimic human tissue architecture and function.\nCompared to traditional 2D cultures, these advanced cell models provide more accurate, cost-efficient, and\nreproducible results while reducing the use of animals in drug development. In addition, the company\nspecializes in advanced imaging and digital pathology for biomedical research. The business complements the\nGroup's portfolio of cell analytical instruments, reagents and AI-supported data models and will be integrated\ninto the Lab Products & Services Division.\n\n**Act for an Immediate Tax Investment Program in Germany**\nThe deferred taxes of the German companies of the Sartorius Group have to be revalued in connection with\nthe “Act for an immediate tax investment programme to strengthen Germany as a business location” passed\nby the Federal Cabinet on July 11, 2025 and the associated gradual reduction of the corporate income tax rate\nfrom the 2028 assessment period. The balance sheet items as of June 30, 2025 are not affected. It is expected\nthat the resulting one-time tax relief in the future will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial\nstatements.\n\nNo material events occurred between the reporting date and the authorization of these interim consolidated\nfinancial statements.\n\n---\n\n Independent Auditors' Review Report\n\n To Sartorius Aktiengesellschaft, Göttingen\n\nWe have reviewed the condensed consolidated interim financial statements – comprising the profit and loss\nstatement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of financial positions (balance sheet),\nconsolidated statement of cash flows, statement of changes in equity and selected explanatory notes – and\nthe interim group management report of Sartorius Aktiengesellschaft, Göttingen, for the period from January\n1 to June 30, 2025, which are part of the half-year financial report pursuant to § [Article] 115 WpHG\n(\"Wertpapierhandelsgesetz\": German Securities Trading Act). The preparation of the condensed consolidated\ninterim financial statements in accordance with the IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted\nby the EU and of the interim group management report in accordance with the provisions of the German\nSecurities Trading Act applicable to interim group management reports is the responsibility of the parent\nCompany's Executive Board.

A review is limited primarily to inquiries of company personnel and analytical procedures\nand therefore does not provide the assurance attainable in a financial statement audit. Since, in accordance\nwith our engagement, we have not performed a financial statement audit, we cannot express an audit opinion.\n\nBased on our review, no matters have come to our attention that cause us to presume that the condensed\nconsolidated interim financial statements have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with\nthe IFRS applicable to interim financial reporting as adopted by the EU nor that the interim group\nmanagement report has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the provisions of the\nGerman Securities Trading Act applicable to interim group management reports.\n\nHanover, July, 21, 2025\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH\nWirtschaftsprüfungsgesellschaft\n\nDr. Thomas Ull ppa.
