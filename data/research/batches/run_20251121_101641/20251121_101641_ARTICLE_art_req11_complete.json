With double-digit growth, our high-margin\nconsumables business remains our key growth driver. Even though customers are still cautious about\ninvesting in equipment and instruments, this business is stabilizing. It is equally encouraging to see that the\nlab division is proving resilient in a persistently challenging market environment and keeps catching up.\nAgainst this backdrop, we are sharpening the full-year forecast and expect Group sales revenue to reach\nthe upper half of the previously defined range,” said CEO Dr. Michael Grosse. “The biopharmaceutical\nmarket is evolving dynamically, fueled by innovation and rising global demand for novel drugs. Our\ncustomers face the urgent challenge of accelerating the development and manufacturing of these new\ntherapeutics while managing increased cost pressures. With our technologies, we are directly addressing\nthis need and contribute to better access to innovative medicine.”\n\nBusiness development of the Group ^1^\nIn the first nine months of the fiscal year, the Sartorius Group achieved considerable sales revenue growth\nof 7.5 percent in constant currencies, compared with the prior-year period, reaching 2,611 million euros.\nReported growth was 5.5 percent, mainly due to the weakness of the US dollar. All business regions\ncontributed to this increase: The Americas region recorded an 8.2 percent rise in constant currencies, while\nAsia/Pacific achieved an 8.7 percent growth in constant currencies. In the EMEA ^2^ region, where business\nrecovery had already begun earlier, sales revenue was up by 6.3 percent.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA significantly outpaced sales revenue growth and rose by 12.8 percent to 774 million\neuros between January and September, with volume, product mix, and economies of scale more than\noffsetting negative currency effects. The corresponding margin rose by 2 percentage points to\n\n1. 7 percent, compared with 27.7 percent in the prior-year period.\n\n| | Earnings Release |\n|--|------------------|\n\n---\n\nUnderlying net profit grew even more strongly, up 17.0 percent to 244 million euros, compared with\n208 million euros in the same period of the previous year. Underlying earnings per ordinary share increased\nto 3.52 euros (PY 3.01 euros) and underlying earnings per preference share to 3.53 euros (PY 3.02 euros).\n\nAs of September 30, 2025, Sartorius employed 13,878 people – an increase of 350 employees compared\nto the end of 2024, – mainly due to the hiring of additional production personnel.\n\nSartorius Group’s balance sheet and key financial indicators remain at robust levels. The equity ratio as of\nSeptember 30, 2025, grew to 39.7 percent (December 31, 2024: 38.6 percent). As planned, the ratio of net\ndebt to underlying EBITDA was reduced further and stood at 3.7 (December 31, 2024: 4.0). Investments\nin the company’s global research and production infrastructure amounted to 305 million euros, after\n319 million euros in the prior-year period. The ratio of capital expenditures to sales revenue increased as\nplanned over the year, reaching 11.7 percent by the end of September (PY 12.9 percent).\n\nBusiness development of the Bioprocess Solutions Division\nThe Bioprocess Solutions Division, which accounts for more than three-quarters of Group sales revenue\nand offers a wide range of innovative technologies for the efficient and sustainable manufacture of\nbiopharmaceuticals, once again recorded significant growth: Between January and September, the\ndivision’s sales revenue increased by 9.9 percent in constant currencies (reported: 7.8 percent) to\n2,115 million euros. The development was driven by the high-margin business with consumables for the\nmanufacture of biopharmaceuticals, which continued its strong growth trend. While remaining soft due to\nthe industry-wide reluctance of customers to invest, business with bioprocess equipment and systems is\nstabilizing.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA rose even more substantially than sales revenue, up 17.3 percent to 667 million euros\n(PY 568 million euros) due to volume and product mix effects as well as economies of scale. The margin\ngrew significantly to 31.5 percent, compared with 28.9 percent in the same period of the previous year.\n\nIn the first nine months of the fiscal year, the bioprocess division expanded its product portfolio to further\nenhance productivity in drug manufacturing, including new offerings for process intensification.\nAdditionally, in the third quarter, an advanced filtration solution for monoclonal antibodies, which enables\nshorter processes and reduces water consumption, as well as new software solutions for bioprocesses, were\nlaunched. The division also entered into a new collaboration with the US start-up Nanotein Technologies\nto advance the commercialization and development of innovative reagents that promote cell activation\nand expansion in cell therapy manufacturing.\n\nBusiness development of the Lab Products & Services Division\nThe smaller of the two divisions, Lab Products & Services, which specializes in life science research and\npharmaceutical laboratories, proved resilient in a persistently challenging market environment: Business\nrecovered gradually in the first nine months and as expected showed a slightly positive growth rate in the\nthird quarter.\n\nBetween January and September, sales revenue was down only slightly, with - 1.3 percent in constant\ncurrencies (reported: - 3.2 percent) to 495 million euros. MATTEK, the microtissue specialist acquired at\nthe beginning of July, contributed almost 1 percentage point to sales revenue growth. Business with\nconsumables for laboratories and services continued to grow significantly. While remaining soft, business\n\n---\n\nwith lab instruments is stabilizing – supported by recent positive momentum in the bioanalytics portfolio,\nto which the product launches of the first half of the year contributed.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA amounted to 108 million euros, down from 118 million euros in the same period of the\nprevious year, mainly due to volume and product mix effects. The corresponding margin reached\n\n1. 7 percent (PY 23.2 percent).\nIn terms of its product portfolio, in addition to the new bioanalytics offerings introduced in the first half of\nthe year, the division recently launched an advancement in the field of weighing technology that enables\nfaster calibration of pipettes in accordance with ISO standards.\n\nGuidance for fiscal 2025 specified\nBased on the year-to-date results and taking into account the anticipated impact of existing tariffs, the\ncontributions from the MATTEK acquisition, as well as the strong basis for comparison in the fourth quarter\nof 2024, management further sharpens its full-year guidance for the Group and both divisions.\n\nThe company now expects sales revenue growth at Group level of around 7 percent (previously: around\n6 percent organic growth with a forecast range of about plus/minus two percentage points). This includes\nan inorganic growth contribution of around 0.3 percent. The Bioprocess Solutions Division is anticipated to\nreach the upper end of the previously defined bandwidth and grow by around 9 percent (previously:\naround 7 percent organic growth with a forecast range of around plus/minus two percentage points). The\nLab Products & Services Division should reach approximately the sales revenue level of the previous year,\nwith a growth contribution of a good 1 percentage point from the acquisition of MATTEK (previously:\naround 1 percent organic growth with a forecast range of about plus/minus two percentage points).\n\nIn terms of profitability, management expects an underlying EBITDA margin at Group level of slightly above\n\n1. 5 percent (previously: around 29 to 30 percent), with the margin of the Bioprocess Solutions Divisionrising to slightly above 31.5 percent (previously: around 31 to 32 percent) and that of the lab division\nreaching around 21.5 percent (previously: around 22 to 23 percent).\n\nThe guidance for the ratio of capital expenditures to sales revenue remains unchanged and is expected to\nbe around 12.5 percent; the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA ^1^ is still anticipated to decrease to\napproximately 3.5.\n\n1 Sartorius publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards. These are\ndetermined with the aim of improving the comparability of business performance over time and within the industry.\n\n- Underlying EBITDA: earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization and adjusted for extraordinary items\n\n- Underlying net profit: profit for the period after non-controlling interest, adjusted for extraordinary items and amortization,\nas well as based on the normalized financial result and the normalized tax rate\n\n- Underlying earnings per share: underlying net profit in relation to the weighted-average number of outstanding ordinary or\npreference shares\n\n- Ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA: quotient of net debt and underlying EBITDA over the past 12 months, including\nthe pro forma amount contributed by acquisitions for this period\n2 EMEA = Europe, Middle East, Africa\n\nThis media release contains forward-looking statements about the future development of the Sartorius Group.

Management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the\nindustry have increased significantly in recent years. In addition, uncertainties due to the changed geopolitical situation, such as the\nemerging decoupling tendencies of various countries as well as the trade policy framework conditions, are playing a greater role. This\nresults in higher uncertainty when forecasting business figures.\n\nExplanation of the business results\nIn the conference call for investors on October 16, 2025, at 1:00 p.m. CEST, CEO Dr. Michael Grosse and\nCFO Dr. Florian Funck will explain the business figures for the first nine months of 2025.
