Sartorius.”\n\n 1888\n**First short-beam analytical balance built**\nFlorenz Sartorius unveiled a short beam\nanalytical balance that stabilized much faster\nthan the conventional balances available.\n\n 1927\n**A Sartorius membrane filter company was**\n**started with Nobel Prize winner Zsigmondy**\nThe company’s primary objective was research\ndevelopment and manufacturing novel\nmembranes.\n\n 1940\n**Manufacture of the first filter devices**\nThe first filter devices manufactured by\nSartorius facilitated breakthroughs in sterile\nfiltration and microbiological testing of liquid\nmedia and gases.\n\n 1945\n**Key player in providing clean drinking**\n**water during World War II**\nDuring and after World War II, people were\nexposed to considerable risk of contracting\ndiseases. Sartorius helped alleviate the\nsituation by providing filters for testing\ndrinking water. These were the beginnings of\nbacteriological analysis, one of Sartorius’s core\nareas of expertise.\n\n 1962\n**Guinness Book of World Records**\nSartorius manufactured a vacuum ultra-\nmicrobalance called “Gastnanogram.” For\nmany decades, it was listed in the Guinness\nBook of World Records as the “most accurate\nbalance in the world.”.\n\n c. 1980\n**The first manufacturer of pleated**\n**membrane filter cartridges**\nSartorius was the first manufacturer to create\nmembrane filter cartridges using pleated\nmaterial well known in air filter technology.\nThis space-saving design is still the basis for\ntoday’s innovations in pleated membrane\nfiltration equipment.\n\n 1969\n**Sartorius is involved in the Apollo 11**\n**mission**\nSartorius caused a worldwide stir by weighing\nthe first moon rocks brought back by Neil\nArmstrong on the Apollo 11 mission.\n\n 1970\n**First subsidiaries founded worldwide**\nAt the beginning of the 1970s, Sartorius\nbegan to establish its own subsidiaries abroad.\n\n1971 – The first subsidiary was founded\nin Austria, then more companies were\nestablished.\n\n1975 - The U.S. subsidiary was incorporated,\nwhich started in a hotel room in San\nFrancisco, California.\n\nSartorius Laboratory Products and\nServices is a global provider offering\nintegrated solutions for your everyday\nlab applications.
