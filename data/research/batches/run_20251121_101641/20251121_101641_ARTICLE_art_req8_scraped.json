(\"Mettler-Toledo\") issued a press release (the Release) setting forth its\nfinancial results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. A copy of the Release is furnished hereto as Exhibit 99.1\nto this report.\n\n**Non-GAAP Financial Measures**\n\nMettler-Toledo supplements its U.S. GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures. The principal non-GAAP financial\nmeasures Mettler-Toledo uses are Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local\nCurrency Sales Growth.\n\n*Adjusted Earnings per Share*\n\nMettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Earnings per Share as diluted earnings per common share excluding certain non-recurring\ndiscrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangible assets, net of tax, restructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time\ncharges, net of tax. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is diluted earnings per common share.\n\nMettler-Toledo believes that Adjusted Earnings per Share is important supplemental information for investors. Mettler-Toledo\nuses this measure because it excludes certain non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangibles, net of tax,\nrestructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time charges, net of tax, which management believes are not directly related to\ncurrent and ongoing operations thereby providing investors with information that helps to compare ongoing operating performance.\n\nAdjusted Earnings per Share is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted Earnings per Share is not intended to represent diluted earnings per common share under U.S. GAAP and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to diluted earnings per common share as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the\nfollowing limitations.\n\n*Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings per Share*\n\nMettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Earnings per Share, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\nIt does not include certain non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization expense of purchased intangibles, net of tax,\nrestructuring charges, net of tax and certain other one-time charges, net of tax. Because non-recurring discrete tax items,\namortization of purchased intangibles, restructuring charges and certain other one-time charges are components of diluted earnings\nper share under U.S. GAAP, any measure that excludes non-recurring discrete tax items, amortization of purchased intangibles,\nrestructuring charges and certain other one-time charges, has material limitations.\n\n---\n\n*Adjusted Operating Profit*\n\nMettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Operating Profit as gross profit less research and development and selling, general and\nadministrative expenses before amortization, interest, restructuring charges and other charges (income), net and taxes. The most\ndirectly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is earnings before taxes.\n\nMettler-Toledo believes that Adjusted Operating Profit is important supplemental information for investors. Adjusted Operating\nProfit is used internally as the principal profit measurement by its segments in their reporting to management. Mettler-Toledo uses\nthis measure because it excludes amortization, interest, restructuring charges and other charges (income), net and taxes, which are\nnot allocated to the segments.\n\nOn a consolidated basis, Mettler-Toledo also believes Adjusted Operating Profit is an important supplemental method of\nmeasuring profitability. It is used internally by senior management for measuring profitability and setting performance targets for\nmanagers, and has historically been used as one of the means of publicly providing guidance on possible future results. Mettler-\nToledo also believes that Adjusted Operating Profit is an important performance measure because it provides a measure of\ncomparability to other companies with different capital or legal structures, which accordingly may be subject to disparate interest\nrates and effective tax rates, and to companies which may incur different amortization expenses or impairment charges related to\nintangible assets.\n\nAdjusted Operating Profit is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAdjusted Operating Profit is not intended to represent operating income under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an\nalternative to earnings before taxes as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the following limitations.\n\n*Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Profit*\n\nMettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Operating Profit, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\n**•**\nIt excludes amortization expense. Because this item is recurring, any measure that excludes amortization expense has\nmaterial limitations.\n**•**\nIt does not include interest expense. Because Mettler-Toledo has borrowed money to finance some of its operations, interest\nis a necessary and ongoing part of its costs and has assisted Mettler-Toledo in generating revenue. Therefore any measure\nthat excludes interest expense has material limitations.\n**•**\nIt excludes restructuring charges. Because restructuring charges are a component of operating income under U.S. GAAP,\nany measure that excludes restructuring charges, has material limitations.\n**•**\nIt excludes other charges (income), net. Because other charges (income), net is a component of operating income under U.S.\nGAAP, any measure that excludes other charges (income), net, has material limitations.\n\n*Adjusted Free Cash Flow*\n\nMettler-Toledo defines Adjusted Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities including proceeds from the sale of\nproperty, plant and equipment, less capital expenditures, and before restructuring, acquisition cost payments, and tax reform\npayments. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is net cash provided by operating activities\n\n---\n\nMettler-Toledo believes Adjusted Free Cash Flow is important supplemental information for investors. It is used internally by\nsenior management for measuring operating cash flow generation and setting performance targets for managers, and has historically\nbeen used as one of the means of providing guidance on possible future cash flows.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted\nFree Cash Flow is not intended to represent net cash provided by operating activities recorded under U.S. GAAP and should not be\nconsidered as an alternative to net cash provided by operating activities as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of\nthe following limitations.\n\n*Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow*\n\nMettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\n**•**\nIt includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and purchases of property, plant and equipment, which\nare not considered to be components of net cash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP. Therefore any measure\nthat includes proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment and purchases of property, plant and equipment has\nmaterial limitations.\n**•**\nIt excludes restructuring, acquisition cost payments, and tax reform payments which is considered to be a component of net\ncash provided by operating activities under U.S. GAAP. Therefore any measure that excludes these items has material\nlimitations.\n\n*Local Currency Sales Growth*\n\nMettler-Toledo defines Local Currency Sales Growth as sales growth excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations\nthat result from translating activity outside of the United States into U.S. dollars. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial\nmeasure is U.S. dollar sales growth.\n\nMettler-Toledo believes that Local Currency Sales Growth is important supplemental information for investors. Mettler-Toledo\nbelieves local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between\nperiods.\n\nLocal Currency Sales Growth is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nLocal Currency Sales Growth is not intended to represent U.S. dollar sales growth under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered\nas an alternative to U.S. dollar sales growth as an indicator of Mettler-Toledo’s performance because of the following limitations.\n\n*Limitations of Mettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Local Currency Sales Growth*\n\nMettler-Toledo’s non-GAAP measure, Local Currency Sales Growth, has certain material limitations as follows:\n\nIt does not include the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations that result from translating activity outside of the United\nStates into U.S. dollars. Because the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is a component of sales growth under U.S.\nGAAP, any measure that excludes the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, has material limitations.\n\nAdjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local Currency Sales Growth should not\nbe relied upon to the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures, but reflect additional measures of comparability and means of\nviewing aspects of Mettler-Toledo’s operations that, when viewed together with its U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying\nreconciliations to net\n\n---\n\nearnings, net cash provided by operating activities and diluted earnings per share, provide a more complete understanding of factors\nand trends affecting its business.\n\nBecause Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Local Currency Sales Growth\nare not standardized, it may not be possible to compare with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or\nsimilar names. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not\nto rely on any single financial measure.\n\nThe Release provides a reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings per Share, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nto the most comparable financial measures recorded under U.S. GAAP. The Release also presents Local Currency Sales Growth in\nconjunction with its most comparable financial measure recorded under U.S. GAAP.\n\n---\n\n**Item 9.01 Financial Statements and Exhibits**\n\nExhibit No. Description\n\n1. 1 Press release, dated November 6, 2025, issued by Mettler-Toledo International Inc.104 Cover Page Interactive Data File (embedded within the Inline XBRL document).*\n\n* Submitted electronically with this Report in accordance with the provision of Regulation S-T.\n\n---\n\nSIGNATURE\n\nPursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the\nundersigned hereunto duly authorized.\n\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nDated: November 6, 2025 By: /s/ Shawn P.

Provided below are the highlights:\n\n- Reported sales increased 8% compared with the prior year.

Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP measure, and a\nreconciliation to EPS is included on the last page of the attached schedules.\n\n**Third Quarter Results**\n\nPatrick Kaltenbach, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our third quarter results were strong and reflected very good\ngrowth, especially in Industrial. I am very pleased with our team’s strong execution as we leverage our Spinnaker sales and\nmarketing program and innovative product portfolio to drive growth while delivering solid EPS.”\n\nGAAP Results\nEPS in the quarter was $10.57, compared with the prior-year amount of $9.96.\n\nCompared with the prior year, total reported sales increased 8% to $1,029.7 million. By region, reported sales increased 10% in the\nAmericas, 13% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Earnings before taxes amounted to $269.2 million, compared with $259.0\nmillion in the prior year.\n\nNon-GAAP Results\nAdjusted EPS was $11.15, an increase of 9% over the prior-year amount of $10.21.\n\nCompared with the prior year, total sales in local currency increased 6%. By region, local currency sales increased 10% in the\nAmericas, 6% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to $309.9 million, compared with the\nprior-year amount of $296.6 million.\n\nAdjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are\nprovided in the attached schedules.\n\n**Nine Month Results**\n\nGAAP Results\nEPS was $28.12, compared with the prior-year amount of $28.55 which included a one-time non-cash tax benefit of $1.07 per share.\n\nCompared with the prior year, total reported sales increased 2% to $2.897 billion. By region, reported sales increased 4% in the\nAmericas, 3% in Europe, and 1% in Asia/Rest of World.

By region, local currency sales as compared to prior year\nincreased 4% in the Americas, were flat in Europe, and increased 1% in Asia/Rest of World. Excluding the impact from delayed\nfourth quarter 2023 shipments that benefited first quarter 2024 sales, year-to-date 2025 local currency sales increased 4%, including\n5% growth in the Americas, 3% growth in Europe, and 2% growth in Asia/Rest of World. Adjusted Operating Profit amounted to\n$829.9 million, compared with the prior-year amount of $848.0 million.\n\nAdjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Profit are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures are\nprovided in the attached schedules.\n\n**Share Repurchase Authorization**\n\nThe Company noted its Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.75 billion to be added to the share repurchase program, which\nhad $1.1 billion remaining as of September 30, 2025. The Company expects the additional authorization will be utilized over the\nnext few years, and that the repurchases will be made through open-market transactions, and the amount and timing will depend on\nbusiness and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.\n\n**Outlook**\nManagement cautions that market conditions are uncertain and could change quickly. Based on today's assessment, management\nanticipates local currency sales for the fourth quarter of 2025 will increase approximately 3%. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be $12.68\nto $12.88, a growth rate of 2% to 4%. Included in the fourth quarter guidance is an estimated 7% gross headwind to Adjusted EPS\ngrowth due to higher tariff costs.\n\nFor the full year 2025, management anticipates local currency sales will increase approximately 2%, which includes a headwind of\napproximately 1.5% from the previously disclosed shipping delays in the fourth quarter of 2023 that benefited the first quarter of\n\n1. Adjusted EPS is forecast to be in the range of $42.05 to $42.25, representing growth of approximately 2% to 3%. This forecastincludes headwinds of approximately 4% from the previously mentioned shipping delays, and an additional 5% gross headwind\nfrom higher tariff costs. This compares with previous local currency sales growth guidance of approximately 1% to 2% and Adjusted\nEPS guidance of $41.70 to $42.20.\n\nThe Company stated that based on its assessment of market conditions today, management anticipates local currency sales growth of\napproximately 4% in 2026. This is expected to result in Adjusted EPS in the range of $45.35 to $46.00, representing growth of\napproximately 8% to 9%.\n\nThe Company does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict with\nreasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the timing and amount of future restructuring and other non-recurring items.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nKaltenbach concluded, “Looking ahead, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities while benefiting from trends like\nautomation, digitalization, and onshoring. We continue to remain very agile as we face several uncertainties in global trade disputes\nand governmental policies. We are confident that our strategic initiatives and strong culture of innovation and operational excellence\nwill enable us to continue delivering strong performance in this dynamic environment. The additional share repurchase authorization\nalso allows us to continue the share repurchase program that has provided strong returns for our shareholders over many years. We\nare confident in our future growth prospects, and our balance sheet and cash flow generation remain strong.”\n\n-2-\n\n---\n\n**Other Matters**\n\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its quarterly results tomorrow morning (Friday, November 7) at 8:30 a.m.\nEastern Time.
