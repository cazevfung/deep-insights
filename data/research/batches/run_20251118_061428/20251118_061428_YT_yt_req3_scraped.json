Now when I previously addressed this, the consensus was that the time of  your training probably doesn’t matter, or at least it is very low in the totem  pole of importance in your training. But, does a new study change  the course of all of this? In other words, should we actually  pay stronger attention to the time we decide to do curls in the squat rack? In this video, we’re going to break down this new study and find out if the  results are meaningful enough to warrant any changes to our wonderful workout plans. Hello, I’m PictureFit, I make videos covering all things health and fitness, and sometimes  just random stuff, with the hopes that this channel can help you with your goals. And I also like the amazing show Mr. Robot. Rami Malek was robbed and should have gotten  an Emmy for each of the show’s four seasons. Now if you watched the content of this  channel enough, you would know that a single lone study shouldn’t heavily dictate  our training or nutrition decisions. We should instead consider it for what it is: one or a  set of data points that show specific outcomes, and if intriguing enough, we can employ  it ourselves all the while understanding that it might or might not make a difference. So with that disclaimer, we’ll go ahead and dive into the details of this new study that looks  into the different outcomes between training in the morning, specifically between 6 and 8 AM, or  training in the evening between 6:30 and 8:30PM. The researchers used a multi-component exercise  approach, consisting of resistance training, your good ol weight lifting,  interval sprints, stretching like Yoga and Pilates, and endurance exercises. The components were performed on separate days, which means four exercise sessions  per week over the course of 12 weeks. So many aspects of training were covered. Strangely enough, those squat rack curls were missing. There were a total of 56 participants for this study, which were first separated into  two sex-based cohorts, one with 30 females, and the other with 26 males. These cohorts were then  randomly assigned to one of two time intervention groups. (15/15 for women, 14AM/12PM for men) Multiple markers of health and fitness were assessed, which we’ll go in-depth in the results. Overall, that’s exercising 4 times a week for 12 weeks, both men and women are  included in the trials, and the focus will be on the time of the day of training. Oh, and one more thing, a big one at that, is that the participants consumed similar dietary  intakes throughout the course of the study. So, the chances of the diet influencing  the results would be fairly low, putting more emphasis on the time of training  to be the likeliest cause of the results. Speaking of results, how  about we check them out now! First, let’s break down the  results into three categories: Improvements on health, improvements on body  composition, and improvements on performance. Let’s start with the women first. For health, the participants that exercised in the morning saw better improvements  in measurements of blood pressure compared to participants exercising in the evening For body composition, they also experienced greater total and abdominal fat loss. For performance, they experienced greater improvements in lower body muscle  power measured through squat jumps. For the women training in the evening,  they saw greater improvements in mood scores as well as satiety, or the feeling of  fullness and satisfaction after eating a meal. For body composition, training at night didn’t  have an upper hand to training in the morning. For performance, the evening group had notably  more improvements, specifically in upper body muscle strength, upper body muscle power, and  even upper body muscle endurance. (pushups) Using the same breakdown for men,  we see that training in the morning actually had… zero physiological advantage  compared to training in the evening. For evening training, in terms of health, there  were greater reductions in systolic blood pressure and feelings of fatigue. For body composition and  slightly for performance, they had an advantage in fat oxidation. For direct performance,  training in the evening had no clear advantage. Now, knowing all of this, it’s important to  remember, though, that one group having an advantage does not mean that the other group did  not improve as well. It simply means that one group performed better in certain categories. It’s also important to recognize that both exercise times had similar improvements  for the large sum of the factors measured. For women, both groups saw similar  improvements in cholesterol, leg strength, sit-ups, flexibility, aerobic endurance (5k time  trial), body fat percentage, and fat-free mass. For men, both improved similarly in heart rate,  upper body strength, upper body power, push-ups, leg strength, leg power, sit-ups, flexibility,  aerobic endurance, body fat percentage, fat mass, and fat-free mass, and mood scores. That’s quite a lot of similarities! So, the key point of the findings is that,  although a good majority of factors measured did not differ between AM and PM training, there were  indeed some standouts worth considering if they are important factors for you and your goals. Especially for women, there are many more differences between morning and evening training. Ultimately, the answer to should we be paying greater attention to the specific time we train  is mostly it depends, specifically on whether the advantages are worth it to you. Overall  though, the answer is closer to not really. It can be quite an inconvenience to adjust your  whole training schedule for these advantages, especially if your schedule  is already well-established. So even if this study moves the needle slightly  for the importance of the time of training, it still does not surpass the bigger  factors, and that’s choosing a time that you can actually stick to and choosing  a time you personally perform your best. If these two factors aren’t met,  then the timing advantages would mean pretty much nothing. Consistency should be your ultimate goal, much like the Emmy’s  consistency on cheating Rami Malek.
