  "transcript": "what if I told you that you could transform your life and unlock almost Limitless potential and it only takes about 15 minutes a day in this video I'm going to talk about something I've been looking for almost all my life the Holy Grail of morning routines after an enormous amount of research experimentation and trial and error I think I finally have it this is the perfect most ultimate morning routine known to man built for efficiency designed for productivity all in pursuit of energy health and well-being and best of all it's all backed by science there's a reason it's like a cheat code for life and no it's not waking up at 5: in the morning if you're new to the channel welcome we talk about the Art and Science of success all mixed with a little bit of entertainment to make the medicine go down this routine is like a stack of dominoes once set in motion it takes a life of its own as long as you stick to the program each Domino knocks effortlessly into the next compliment ing each other in a growing Cascade of synergistic benefits you'll soon see what I mean it all starts with the first Domino waking up get this Domino right and the entire routine falls into place get it wrong and the entire thing collapses there's three rules to the first Domino one don't negotiate with terrorists two the snooze button doesn't exist and three get on the ground the don't negotiate with terrorists rule is about your brain the moment the alarm goes off is the moment your brain starts negotiating get up now are you crazy it's warm it's cozy just press snooze it's only a few more minutes you'll feel amazing I promise except it's never just a few more minutes and afterwards you'll still feel like that's why you don't negotiate with terrorists there's nothing to talk about if the snooze button doesn't exist I use an old school alarm clock because one it literally doesn't have a snooze button and two it's loud as heck the secret is to keep it under your bed so when it goes off you have to literally get on the floor and reach in there with your full arms length this is perfect because it automates the third rule getting on the ground here on the ground the second Domino begins high intensity exercise personally I do push-ups bicycle crunches planks it doesn't really matter the trick is to keep on exercising until you are literally Wide Awake high-intensity exercise provides several immediate benefits according to Dr abon ski exercise physiologist at the Mayo Clinic high-intensity exercises increases your Peak V2 how much oxygen your heart can pump throughout the body this is the literal gold standard for cardiorespiratory Fitness increased Peak BO2 is associated with longer life and a healthier heart furthermore high-intensity exercises increases production of bdnf brain derived neurotrophic Factor A protein that supercharges your brain delays Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and promotes neuroplasticity the ability of the brain to form new synaptic connections perfect for learning growing and thinking according to research in the Journal of physiology it only takes 4 minutes and can increase circulating bdnf by 4 to 5 times in Just 4 minutes you can potentially quintuple your brain power holy smokes if stronger lungs brains and hearts don't do it for you consider the extra benefits of a boost in Adrenaline you get to wake up jump start your metabolism get warm make an immediate deposit into the bank account of small winds and build insane momentum the moment you wake up and once fired up guess what you're perfectly set up for the third Domino a cold shower if you've done the second Domino right you should now be hot and sweaty get up from the ground walk out of your bedroom strip off your clothes and head straight into the shower if a cold shower sounds terrifying don't worry the largest study of cold showers to date a randomized control trial of 3,8 participants shows you only need 30 seconds of a cold shower to reap its benefits and even better you can even start off with a regular hot shower first those who took a daily 30second cold shower for 30 days were 29% less likely to call off work due to sickness a study by jansy hypothesizes it is due to a slight boost in one's immune system other studies report benefits related to the reduction in muscle inflammation soreness and even improved muscular microvascular circulation which again is perfect because you just blasted your muscles some proponents even think it may be a potential treatment for depression the theory goes something like this the cold shower activates the high density of cold receptors on the skin sending an enormous Brigade of electrical impulses to the brain the neurologic overload is thought to cause a gigantic release of natural endorphins as a protective mechanism all put together there seems to be something there the evidence could definitely be stronger but if all it takes us 30 seconds and there's virtually little downside why not at the very least use it to one further wake yourself up and two exploit it as a level three Habit to improve self-discipline and resiliency if you're not familiar with the three habit levels a simple framework used for consistent personal growth check out this video next Once those 30 seconds are up step out of the shower and head over to the fourth Domino the most important 5 minutes of your entire day it's called The Sacred five in these sacred 5 minutes you tackle the most important most difficult task you have there's no better time to work on that thing you've been putting off in right now your brain is supercharged you're alert your adrenaline is pumping and endorphins are everywhere at this moment you are quite literally at the height of your powers your brain chalk full of bdnf is primed and since you haven't burned a single ounce of dopamine on other stupid things like scrolling social media the full dopamine nurg stack is at your disposal I talk about the concept of the dopamine power meter in this video so check it out to get a deep dive on motivation when you bring down the full force of your mind and focus that supercomputer in your skull on these next 5 minutes you end up doing the best work of your life string together a consistent habit of 5 minutes a day and you might just change your life again it's just 5 minutes there should be no excuse not to the barrier of Entry is virtually zero 5 minutes is rounding error even a baby puppy can sit for just 5 minutes but the power of just 5 minutes is sorely underestimated not only do 5 minutes a day add up quickly you'll find yourself often working much longer than 5 minutes when your brain has a full stack of dopamine at its disposal not to mention further boosted by four to five times the amount of bdnf you'll find slipping into a flow state to be incredibly easy AKA being in the zone it's an incred L rewarding mental state where you become fully immersed in the task at hand a kind of effortless Focus where you lose track of both time and self-consciousness once 5 minutes are up or you decide to exit the Flow State you are then ready for the final Domino the optimize reset your brain and your body quite literally was firing on all cylinders you still have the entire day in front of you so to promote maximum long-term stamina and Longevity you need to optimize your rest and Recovery in other words you need to recharge speaking of recharging the best way I recharge is with the world's most advanced sleep mask invented by mantis sleep this video is kind sponsor after working the night shift as an ER doc treating all sorts of stuff like hang nails mad cow disease and Kangaroo fever all I want to do is sleep but it's hard to do so when the sun ends up stabbing my eyeballs for 8 hours straight with its happy rays of sunshine and the birds oh gosh the birds chirping away at the top of their lungs trying to get laid with no consideration for anybody else nobody cares if you're horny you stupid bird that's why this sleep mask is clutch when I put it on I notice a few things immediately one because everything about this mask is easily adjustable it's incredibly comfortable two the c-shaped tapered eye cups put zero pressure on my eyelids and three even with breathable light fabric it's still able to deliver a complete 100% blackout experience and for the birds I switch to the sound mask it is Bluetooth speakers built right into the fabric you can even adjust where the speakers are in case your ear holes aren't where they're supposed to be those birds don't stand a chance when I drown them out with some classic death metal lullabies Manas sleep as other versions too a cooling mask a steam mask a silk mask and even a weighted mask this thing is a game changer check out manto sleep in the description below and use code spoonfed study to get 10% off your manta order now back to the video there are three mini dominoes for the optimized reset the first mini Domino is your body so let's fuel it the most efficient breakfast is one that requires zero prep no cooking no cleaning just maximum health I grab a cucumber a bunch of baby carrots some cherry tomatoes A Fistful of peanuts and wash it all down with milk if I'm feeling particularly hungry I'll eat an avocado and a banana as well ensuring no processed food in minimal carbs eliminates food coma and keeps me alert if for whatever reason you cannot or don't want to avoid carbs one study shows that blue light after food reduced brain wave activity associated with drowsiness blue light suppresses the secretion of melatonin the hormone that influences circadium rhythms in the promotion of sleep thus to fight food coma blast your face with blue light you can do so with a sunlamp or you know just use that giant light bulb in the sky called the sun speaking of which second mini Domino is your mind your mind is like a cute little plant to grow you need to bathe that little guy in sunlight feed it plenty of water and let it hang out in its natural environment I mean think about it where do you think you'll Thrive more stuck inside some dirty stuffy room or in an Open Meadow surrounded by Mother Nature blue skies and fresh air there's ample scientific evidence now that exposure to Nature is associated with improved cognitive function improved executive function and and perceived restorativeness not to mention brain activity cardiovascular disease mental health and sleep in one study of us students students who engage with green spaces for at least 15 minutes for four times a week had higher quality of life better overall mood and lower stress a second study showed that this was also associated with a lower risk of depression with a third study showing improvements even in ADHD with higher standardized test scores this area of research stems from something called the bio filia hypothesis it argues that humans have evolved with nature to have an affinity for nature two major theories have come from this the tension restoration Theory and the stress reduction theory in the first Theory scientists believe that Modern Life has resulted in a depleted capacity to direct attention being unable to directly command your attention is that annoying phenomenon where you want to focus on something you even know how important it is to do so but for whatever reason are not physically able to do it it's not your brain's fault it's your environment given this scientists have found that spending time in natural environments enables people to overcome this mental fatigue and restore their capacity to direct attention stress reduction theory posits that being in nature also activates the parasympathetic nervous system reducing Stress and Anxiety and general autonomic arousal all that's to say hopefully you have something green around you if so take a quick stroll outside and breathe in that fresh air at a minimum I'll take my bre breakfast and sit by my open patio door bathe in the sunlight and focus on all the green trees and plants outside third and final mini Domino is your emotional health I.E your spirit we've talked about this before but the practice of gratitude improves your mental health and increases activation of the medial prefrontal cortex the part of your brain used in learning and decision-making we talk more about the scientific studies of gratitude in this video so go there if you haven't seen it already practicing gratitude isn't just some hokey woo woo hand waving nonsense in fact even 3 weeks of consistent gratitude practice results in long-term brain changes that influence how you see the world real brain changes that can be detected with functional MRI studies if you've been looking for the quickest shortcut to happiness this is it it's literally the easiest and most efficient way to improve life satisfaction and so as I'm basking away in the sunlight chewing on fresh vegetables enjoying the Cool Breeze and smiling at the little squirrels waving Tiny Paws at me I take some time to breathe to relax to savor this quiet little pocket of time grateful that I'm getting to enjoy yet another beautiful moment like this because for all I know tomorrow is not guaranteed and just like that the morning routine is done I'm recharged and ready for another exciting day's Adventure wherever it may lead me this may all seem like a lot but it really isn't it boils just down to a few things destroying the snooze button 4 minutes of high-intensity exercise exercise 30 seconds of a cold shower 5 minutes of deep work and however many minutes it takes you to chew on carrots in the sunlight surrounded by as much green nature as possible all the while grateful for having woken up yet another day altogether that's less than 15 minutes of total time this entire routine is a concept I like to call the clean morning notice that nowhere in this routine do you use your phone or scrolled social media in a clean morning you don't waste time you don't play games you don't reach for Netflix the only sources of dopamine you feed yourself are those that align with your long-term goals that means important work you care about mindfulness meditation exercise being in nature and eating healthy but don't just stop there keep the momentum going get so far ahead in the morning that the afternoon isn't even needed this is how you do more in one day than most people do an entire week this is how you widen the Gap and become your ultimate best self I hope today's video brought you some
