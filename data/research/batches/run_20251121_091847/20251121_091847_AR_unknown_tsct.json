And\nit’s built on a foundation of strong technical\nsupport and services.\n\nAn important focus at Agilent is increasing\ninstrument productivity. We’re continuously\ndevising ways to increase throughput, often\nwithout the need to change methods. A\ngood example of this is Capillary Flow\nTechnology, enabling a number of GC\napplications that save time and improve\nresults without altering the basic\nchromatographic run.\n\nThese days, most laboratories need to do\nmore with less: To run more samples per\nshift without adding bench space or people.\nTo maximize instrument utilization. To\nminimize maintenance costs. We help them\nattain these goals and more by addressing\ntheir complete workflows. Because true\ngains are achieved only by eliminating\nbottlenecks, not by merely moving them.\n\n Chemical Analysis Solutions\n\nFrom high-volume screening of vegetables for pesticides through detection\nof genetically-modified products, Agilent understands the analytical needs of\nfood producers, shippers and regulators. When a new contaminant appears,\nwe deploy substantial resources to quickly help customers develop robust,\nreliable methods.\n\n Food\n\nAgilent offers more than 40 years of environmental analysis and regulatory\nexpertise. We help government and private labs with a full range of assays,\nfrom routine testing of soils for heavy metals through detection of\npharmaceuticals in groundwater in concentrations down to parts-per-trillion.\n\n Environmental\n\nAgilent closely collaborates with process industry customers to offer analytical\nsystems to meet their needs for separation, detection, throughput and support.\nWe’ll even preconfigure custom or standard analyzers so they arrive at the lab\nready-to-go. Agilent offers useful innovations such as Low Thermal Mass GC\nand Capillary Flow Technology that greatly increase sample throughput and\nfacilitate challenging applications such as simulated distillation.\n\n Hydrocarbon Processing and Petroleum\n\nBecause the futures of world class athletes and many other individuals hinge\non drug testing, it’s critical that those doing the testing have the highest level\nof confidence in their results. Forensics analysts worldwide have grown to\ndepend on Agilent tools for accuracy, reliability and speed in this high-stakes,\nhigh-throughput field. Our best selling GC, GC/MS and popular LC and LC/MS\nare workhorses in forensics labs.\n\n Forensics\n\nThe way labs generate and store data profoundly affect their efficiency.\nAgilent offers a comprehensive selection of software, ranging from\nindustry-leading instrument control capabilities in our data systems\nthrough an innovative operating system for the laboratory that provides\na fully searchable archive for all data, regardless of file type.\n\n Lab Informatics\n\n| | |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| IAC_update_01_Intro.qxd:Interior layout 6/17/09 10:38 AM Pag | e 2 |\n\n---\n\n Life Science Solutions\n\nDrug discovery, development and manufacturing requires the\naccuracy, sensitivity and high throughput of other analytical\napplications, with the added demands of regulatory record-\nkeeping and validation requirements.
