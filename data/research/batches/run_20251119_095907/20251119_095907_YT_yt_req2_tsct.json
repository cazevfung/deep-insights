  "content": "I'm going to try to keep it together here. Just last year, Phil Spencer, the CEO of Xbox, stepped forward to say that increasing prices over $70 would be manipulative. Do I need to say anything more? Do not trust these people. And please stop defending them. Xbox was the last company that I would have expected to join the price hike club. Because while I will largely applaud them for getting rid of console exclusivity, I think that that's generally a good thing. And I know that there is a broader strategy to these price increases. It still doesn't make sense. Not from a players perspective and definitely not even from a business perspective. Outside of a couple of decent games, Xbox firstp party titles just aren't good. People are not going to be lining up to spend $80 on an Xbox game right now. You might get a handful, but not nearly as many as you're going to need. And it feels like every single time they go to pick up a publisher or a studio, they find a way to ruin it in one way, shape, or form. Except for Activision Blizzard King. And well, you can't necessarily ruin what is already effectively video game Satan. So there you go. You don't have the faith of the wide vast majority of players that play video games today. You are the weakest of the three platform holders. You are years behind in console sales and you're increasing prices across the board. What are you doing? I know what you're doing. You're terrified because Xbox, like all of these other companies, have built their castles on sand and because of rising development costs, because you guys consolidated your industries overseas and now are threatened by tariffs because piracy is on the rise. Because indie developers are putting out breakout hits because the EU Commission is now targeting microtransactions. The tide is coming in and you're all about to be washed out. Initially through GameStop, Xbox announced price hikes across the board, increasing the price of digital games up to $80 starting next year and increasing the price of their hardware and accessories anywhere from 20 to 30 to even charging $729 for the Xbox Series X2 TBTE console. more expensive than the PlayStation 5 Pro. Pricing yourself higher than your competition who's out selling you three to one is a bold strategy and not one that I was expecting. At the end of my Oblivion video, I had said, \"I don't trust these companies to make smart choices, and I hate being right.\" At first, I thought Xbox was pricing the Oblivion remaster at $50 as a direct response to Nintendo increasing their prices and dropping their Zelda remaster at $90. And honestly, I still think it was. Aspen Gold nailed it on Twitter. He said that 2025 and 2026 will be the years of remasters and remakes. Cheap to create compared to a new game, quantifiable existing audience, boost visibility for upcoming titles. Gears of War, Eay, little to no risk of controversy or boycott. Literally the easiest W in the industry right now. Honestly, I cannot believe that this guy can find time to post industry insights while also doing home improvement. But honestly, he's not wrong, especially when that remaster is as transformative as Oblivions, and especially if it's priced fairly. New releases are a minefield right now, plagued by creative missteps, content that nobody asked for, and player backlash. So, returning to the past makes sense. Players want something familiar, something proven. Reviving these beloved games with modern upgrades is a great way to answer that call while avoiding any backlash that's been plaguing a lot of these new IPs and modern releases. Though Oblivion censorship has raised some eyebrows, but the part that has been glossed over, the part that deserves a little bit more attention here is that this isn't just a visibility boost. It's Xbox clawing back into relevance. These aren't just nostalgic remasters. These are cultural recall grenades. And with the $40 Gears of War remaster, seemingly aiming at the exact same level of quality as the Oblivion one, Xbox has found a strategy that actually makes sense. Cost effective, highquality reminders of what the brand used to be and used to stand for. These games aren't locked behind exclusivity either. They're multiplatform, meaning that Xbox gets to reintroduce itself to players they've either lost or never had. And I'll be honest, I think this is smart. But here's the problem. It completely undercuts their justification for the price hikes everywhere else. Let's be real, Xbox is the last company that should be selling $80 games. Their recent titles have not earned it. When I think of an $80 game, I could maybe spend that on Elden Ring, Balders's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Armored Core 6, games that gave me something complete, something real. I'm not thinking Halo Infinite, Avowed, or Starfield. And sure, that's subjective, but it's also about standards. Larian, Warhorse, From Software. They're not milking players through microtransactions. They're not nickel and dimming people with battle passes and halfbaked launches. They sell you a game. That's it. Now, Xbox, on the other hand, survives off of the back of Call of Duty microtransactions and reoccurring subscription revenue. Their games have not hit. Their platform sales are down. And now, with the excuse of Nintendo increasing their prices to $80, opening the floodgates, Xbox is the first in line to raise their prices across the board. Games, hardware, all of it. It doesn't feel strategic. It feels desperate. I mean, just last year, Phil Spencer said that raising prices beyond $70 could become manipulative. In his words, we went through co we found more ways of getting more money per player. I think that at some point you reach the peak of that and frankly it could go to places that are manipulative and I'm not a big fan of that. Then Microsoft would then go on to record $94 billion in profit. They would then double their growth. Their valuation hits 3.4 trillion and suddenly we are expected to believe that they have to increase prices because of rising development costs and economic uncertainty. Snakes in the grass slither fast. I said this in my Oblivion video and I'm going to say it again. Xbox may be the weakest platform right now, but that's exactly what makes them the most dangerous. With Game Pass and cross-platform releases, they can undercut their competition on their competition's own platforms. But instead of using that power to offer better value, they're just hiking their prices like everyone else. They issued a statement saying, \"We understand that these changes are challenging and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Sure, careful consideration until you realize the whole thing is just them passing the buck to the players. You know, everybody wants to pin these price hikes on the US trade war. And while that might be an agitator, I'm not buying it. Xbox is behind in the console race. You really don't think that there isn't a stockpile of unsold hardware somewhere? That Xbox that you're buying off the shelf right now wasn't made yesterday. It was made months ago. If these tariffs were such a serious issue, they could just slow down production, stagger the releases. Hell, with the profits that they're pulling in, they could eat the costs and not even feel it. But they won't because tariffs are just a convenient scapegoat. And even if they were rescended tomorrow, these prices would stay the exact same. What absolutely drives me up the wall is how transparent this whole thing is. These price hikes are a direct consequence of poor planning. Rising costs wouldn't be a factor if you hadn't bet your entire hardware operation in one country. If it wasn't for tariffs, it would have been something else. Supply chain failure, political unrest, a factory fire. These are self-inflicted wounds. So why is this happening? Why are all of these companies hiking their prices, slashing jobs, and trying to gaslight us into thinking it's all for our benefit? Well, the real answer is investor pressure. That's it. Gaming has become a hotbed for investors. It's not like traditional industries. Once hardware is out of the way, it's pure margin for the most part. No factories, no trucks, no physical goods, just code. And once they got your attention, they can sell you the exact same pixels over and over again. That's what they're protecting. Not the cost of development, but the rate of return. Live service games have become the golden goose in this industry. Infinite growth, infinite spend. You don't need to sell a game anymore. You sell a lifestyle. Look at Take Two. Their entire business is propped up by two things. GTA Online and NBA 2K's microtransaction economies. EA the same thing. FC, formerly FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, three live service ecosystems that print money daily. Activision Blizzard, the only reason that they were worth $70 billion for Microsoft was because of World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. No innovation, no creativity, just predictable revenue. And it's that predictable revenue that has completely warped the conversation around development costs. We keep hearing about how games are more expensive to make than ever. But what they won't say out loud is they are the ones who made it that way. You do not get to cry poor after making billions of dollars in revenue, hiring thousands of people across a dozen studios, scaling up to unsustainable sizes, and then acting shocked when your overhead crushes your margins. GTA 6 is the perfect example. That game is taking longer to develop than every GTA combined. That's not because of creative ambition. It's because the machine behind it has become bloated, inefficient, and addicted to scale. That's not spending smarter. That's spending more. And they're expecting us to pay for it. What makes this all the more frustrating is that this industry is not struggling. Not even close. The last 30 years have been defined by record-breaking profits year over year over year. Xbox just had its best year ever. None of these companies are tightening their belts. Their executives aren't taking pay cuts. There's no scaledback bonuses, just mass layoffs and price hikes because they want to keep the party going at the top while cutting off everything else or just making you pay for it. And that's the thing that they don't want you guys to think about. This isn't about inflation. It's not about tariffs. It's not about rising development costs. It's about control. Xbox wants these price hikes. Ooh, they want them badly because if they can make traditional gaming so financially exhausting, $80 games, $700 consoles, $100 accessories, so they can herd their players towards services that they can control. Live service games, free-to-play, game pass, cloud gaming, controlled storefronts, closed ecosystems, the long game. They're just trying to boil the frog. These guys aren't even competing with each other anymore. It's so transparent. Microsoft buys Activision for $69 billion. Sony buys Bungie for 3.6 million. These aren't random events. These are symptoms of a market consolidating so aggressively that there is no pressure to undercut each other. No official collusion, just a shared understanding that if they all raise prices together, the customer will have nowhere else to go. And the worst part is they're doing it like it's going to benefit the industry in some way. They blame global instability, rising costs, economic pressure, but they're just using it as a smoke screen to justify whatever their next gamble is. the next experiment. All of it, every last move, is designed to shift the cost of their mistakes onto you. This isn't a strategy. It's survival. It's desperation that's dressed up in a suit and tie. And the more they raise the floor, the more players are going to start looking for the exit. Man, Xbox really love that quote from Ubisoft. Players need to get comfortable not owning their games. They thought to themselves, that's a strategy. That's a plan we can get behind. Let's make the market so uncomfortable for players to own anything, to own games or to own hardware that the lowincome and middle inome customers are likely to take the bait and go for Game Pass or go for cloud gaming or any of these other subscription services because why would I pay $80 when I could pay $20 a month and play all of these games rather than just get one little measly game? I mean, these services are so fair. They're so cheap. They're so effective until next year or the year after that where because of rising development costs and economic uncertainty, the price has to go up by 10 or $15. But don't worry because just like Netflix, we have an option for you price sensitive customers. Game Pass Basic with ads, PlayStation Plus Basic with ads, Ubisoft Basic with ads. Then after that, they're going to start selling you frame rates and resolution. We've seen this happen before. Like, I don't understand how people think that this isn't going to happen. I've had people push back on it. That's not what's going to happen. What are you stupid? You deserve to You deserve to pay these prices. Gaming is slowly being monetized into a hellscape like every other industry that's out there. And it's all to attract more investors. Notice how every single year they have to break record profits higher and higher and higher and higher without ever trying to lower their floor. The funny thing is this isn't like any other industry. We have options. We can go anywhere else that we want to. Hell, we're not even buying most of your games to begin with. I don't think that they understand how much trouble that they're in right now because one, I don't even think players are going to buy into this. I'm sure that there's going to be some people that are going to hop on the train and some of these bigger games that are going to come out that we know for a fact are actually good and if it's $80, people will still pay for it. But for the most part, when I talk to other people about these price changes, when I see my YouTube comments or I see things that people say on Twitter, it's apathy more than anything else. They don't care. Okay, I wasn't going to buy it anyway. That's the attitude that I'm seeing. I mean, all of this price pressure that we're seeing right now is coming from AAA, which nobody's really buying right now. Sure, a couple of those games are doing well, but the vast majority of them are not. Why would I want to spend $80 to play Fable next year when I could use that money to buy two Expedition 33s? Doesn't make any sense. You know, the worst part is they need to charge a lot more than $80 because the EU is about to pull the rug right out from underneath these guys. You know what I find interesting? Players aren't yelling anymore. Not like they used to. We've been through the same outrage cycle so many times that the tone is shifted when people are talking about $80 games or $700 consoles now. It's not anger, it's apathy. The reaction isn't don't do this to us. It's go ahead and destroy yourselves. I think that's where I am with a lot of this right now. I find their missteps to be more entertainment than their games are anymore. The bad games, the price hikes, the censorship, the controversy. Sitting back and watching PlayStation continue to chase the live service ghost as Marathon and Arc Raiders drop their alpha tests. right next to each other and the contrast between the two couldn't be any more glaring. Marathon losing players every single day. Their alpha was out while Ark Raiders kept growing. One game feeling like it's going to be the next big thing and the other one feeling like a trendchaser that's trying to fit in with the cool kids. Again, another game being made by a studio with half of the amount of developers. The highest levels of this industry have become so disconnected and so corporatized that they are blind to what players want. They think that our complaints are nothing more than whining. They listen to their board of directors or their sensitivity training. They're more worried about their next earnings call than the customers. We've become the last thing on their minds. And when you ignore us, we start to ignore you, your games, your platforms. Eventually, all of it becomes a symbol for everything that people don't want or want to support. So, we start going somewhere else. And that's exactly what's happening right now. I mean, the three highest player rated games of this year so far are Expedition 33, Blueprints, and Split Fiction. All of them launched at $50 or less. Split Fiction just passed 4 million copies sold. Expedition 33 hit 2 million copies sold in 2 weeks. Games made with a fraction of the money in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the developers providing exponentially more creativity and enjoyment. These aren't flukes. These are signals, and they're being ignored. These publishers are still operating like it's 2016, thinking that a massive budget, cinematic trailers, and a big IP is enough to be able to capture everybody's attention. But markets have changed. Markets do change. Just look at the top games on Steam right now. Most of them are cheap, old or indie. Outside of Balders's Gate 3, it's almost impossible to find a fullpriced game that has cracked the top 10 for longer than a week. That's why these price hikes just don't make any sense to me. A study last year showed that nearly 60% of all play time was spent in games that are more than 6 years old. The only new titles that have seemed to be able to break through are either free-to-play, higheffort indie titles that are priced fairly, or massive AAA projects that actually deliver what players are looking for, like Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Blackmth Wukong, or Space Marine 2. So, while these companies keep tightening their grip, pushing subscription models, raising base prices, and padding every single experience with battle passes and microtransactions, they're missing the bigger picture, the model they're chasing is already collapsing. I mean, take a look at highbudget movies and streaming services right now. The same industries that these guys are trying to emulate are already burning out. Just last year, PC Magazine published a report showing that internet piracy is on the rise again, up 36% from 2020. Why? Because content is fragmented across multiple services, prices keep going up and value keeps going down. Does that sound familiar to you guys at all? According to the study, piracy sites received 141 billion visits in the last year alone. That's more than the height of COVID lockdowns. The US leads the charge in piracy traffic. And it's not just movies and television anymore. It's games, too. Because when you lock all that content behind six different pay walls and continue to raise the prices, well, people don't get mad. They just find another way. So audiences today are either avoiding these products altogether or they're subverting the system to be able to find them for cheap or for free, making all these highbudget projects nearly impossible to find a profit in. But that's okay, right? Because I mean, they still have all that microtransaction income to be able to fall back on. Well, I wouldn't be too sure of that. Over the last few months, the European Union has ramped up its efforts to clamp down on what they call predatory monetization practices in gaming. All stemming from complaints about a mobile game called Star Stable Online. But it's quickly ballooned into something much bigger. The EU is now investigating the use of dark patterns, FOMOdriven events, psychological currency obuscation, and the lack of return policies for in-game purchases. If these rules go into effect, and there is growing pressure to make this law, it won't just affect mobile games. It will impact everything. And I can already hear the counterargument for this. They'll just make a different version of the game for other regions. But that's not going to happen. That's not how modern global releases work anymore. Look how every gotacha game or every RPG now shows its drop rates and its gotcha rates. And that's all based on a law from China. It tends to not really be worth the effort or the cost to manage different versions of the game. And plus, on top of that, their motivations to make a different version of the game would be so transparent that it would beg litigation. I'm telling you right now, if a return policy becomes mandatory in one region, it's going to be implemented everywhere. And that alone could shatter the very foundation of this entire microtransaction economy. Because these purchases are not made out of value. They are made out of impulse. They are emotional, compulsive, dopamine-driven decisions designed to wear off quickly. That's what they want them to do. And if you give people a few hours to reconsider and refund those purchases, the entire system collapses. And that's not hyperbole. Keep in mind the most biggest publishers in this industry, EA, Take 2, Microsoft, Sony, Epic, they are all held up by this model. Anything that could disrupt the balance of it would threaten to break the entire thing. Right now, most of the industry's revenue isn't coming from games. It's coming from that ecosystem. Epic has Fortnite. EA has FC. Apex Legends and Madden. Microsoft has Call of Duty. Nintendo is pulling in billions from the Pokemon titles. And Sony, well, we already know they've been desperately trying to chase live service games for years. But this is the only path they have. This is their only path to growth. This is the only path that investors understand. And without them, they're nothing. In 2025 alone, Microsoft's content and services revenue went up by 8%. Not because of great new games that they had released, but because of subscriptions and microtransactions. When they acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, their overall gaming revenue jumped by 49%. content and services, meaning reoccurring payments and microtransactions, grew by 61%, consuming the vast majority of their earnings. If the European Union cracks down on digital currencies and dark patterns, and other countries continue to regulate things like loot boxes and gambling and video games, it's not just going to be a bad quarter, it's going to be a market reset. And most of these companies have nothing of substance to be able to fall back on. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I think one of the only reasons that we haven't seen any big moves towards regulation of microtransactions is because of the complete economic collapse that it would cause in the gaming industry. These guys have built their entire businesses around being able to psychologically manipulate their audience and extract as much reoccurring revenue as possible. And they've done it while constantly scaling up their companies to absurd proportions, adding more developers, more marketing, and more money. And they've gotten used to this arrangement. The industry is wildly underregulated, which is exactly why it's grown so fast and attracted so much outside capital. But that gold rush is coming to an end. Because if consumer protection start forcing these companies to act ethically or even transparently, the entire business model falls apart. And of course, things are only getting worse for these guys. Because add to the fact that one of their hidden revenue streams just got unraveled. Ubisoft is currently under legal fire for allegedly harvesting behavioral data through their online only single player games and likely their multiplayer games as well. That's why these guys wanted us to be online all the time. Data that they can analyze, sell, and use to manipulate the players all without ever asking for permission. This is what the modern gaming industry is built on right now. Addiction loops, monetization funnels, data mining, and psychological manipulation that's disguised as entertainment. And now that that's all starting to collapse, under regulatory pressure, under consumer fatigue, under the weight of a leaner, smarter, and more successful indie scene, these guys are panicking. They're raising their prices. They're pushing subscriptions even harder. They're throttling features and slapping payw walls on content that used to be free. I mean, it's now rumored that Call of Duty is going to start to paywall their events and gameplay modes. I'm telling you right now, this isn't going to work because the players that used to be there aren't going to be fooled anymore. And the ones that do care have already walked away. And the ones that are still there aren't going to be enough. I think I might have brought this up before, but they keep trying to treat this industry like it's every other industry, which makes a lot of sense because a lot of these CEOs are coming from other places than gaming. But it's just not how this beast is built. It's just not how it works. It's the psychology of the whole thing. It's how people interact with these products. We don't even think of them as products. We think of them as games. We think of them as experiences. We think of them as worlds that we're visiting, as memories that we are having, as memories that we are sharing, ones that we plan on returning to or may return to in the future or whatever it might be. And we play these games, we don't consume them. And that's a completely different interaction than you see in a lot of other industries. And I think that they've lost touch with that. And I think that's more evident by the day, to be honest with you. They left the players behind. They've been making worse games. They've been trying to monetize them even further. And even if they can make a good game, it's likely too expensive for us to buy or it's too expensive for them to make. I mean, look at how high these guys have risen the stakes for themselves. Grand Theft Auto 6 is estimated to be $2 billion in development costs. That is insane. You cannot keep up with that. You can't even compete with that. effectively to just make what the AAA industry is supposed to be making in the first place. They have to sell like 30 plus million copies to be able to break even after fees and things like that on other platforms. They can pull that off, but the vast majority of the industry doesn't stand a chance. Are you kidding me? But these are the costs that continue to rise. They keep doing this to themselves. They keep scaling up and scaling out and they use subscription services and microtransactions to be able to offset that growth and show that perpetual record-breaking growth that they need to to show to their shareholders because most of these CEOs are paid in stock options to begin with that never take pay cuts, by the way, regardless of how many people they lay off or how bad their business does. notice most of these gaming CEOs never lose their job, you know, and with the subscription services, I don't think I think it's going to be around. I think it's going to stick around, but I don't think it's ever going to be as popular as these companies are hoping it's going to be. They want it to be because it's the best and the most control that they'll ever be able to have over their consumer base. But I just think that people want to have their library. I think they want to have their games that they can go back to. I think they like buying things when they're on sale. People like feeling like they're getting a deal on something and people just want their games. Physical copies of games still sell. Expedition 33's physical copies sold out in multiple countries. And with microtransactions, that entire ecosystem is built on psychology, manipulation. They have to manipulate the player to be able to get that money. And if that is disrupted in any way, if there is legislation against it that gets rid of dark patterns or gets rid of anything, these guys are cooked. They won't stand a chance. You will see companies that you never thought would go out of business go out of business overnight. Honestly, I can't wait to watch it all backfire. It has been so much fun to sit back and watch as these indie companies have just been running circles around these guys lately. It has been crazy. The amount of just random out of nowhere developers making tons of money, making games that are incredibly popular and absolutely beloved, it has just been so much fun. And keep in mind, you know, for every copy of Expedition 33 that sells, that's one less copy of Assassin's Creed that gets sold. These companies do directly compete with their games, even though they don't like to compete on their prices in a lot of cases, at least not on the AAA side, but that's how this whole thing works. So, you know, they hate to see it. They'll act like they're happy to see these guys do well. I was talking to an indie developer the other day and he had said that because of the direction that the industry is headed in, it has created so many opportunities for these guys to make money and they are so happy that these guys keep self-sabotaging themselves. He's like, \"It has never been better to be an indie dev.\" I told him, \"You guys are making it or it's never been better to be a gamer.\" So, hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you guys did enjoy the video, subscribe to the channel, comment down below, like the video, share the video, and come follow me on Twitch. I'll be streaming today, actually. So, yeah. Stay cool, stay righteous, stay safe. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. Family. Family. I'm going to try to keep it together here. Just last year, Phil Spencer, the CEO of Xbox, stepped forward to say that increasing prices over $70 would be manipulative. Do I need to say anything more? Do not trust these people. And please stop defending them. Xbox was the last company that I would have expected to join the price hike club. Because while I will largely applaud them for getting rid of console exclusivity, I think that that's generally a good thing. And I know that there is a broader strategy to these price increases. It still doesn't make sense. Not from a players perspective and definitely not even from a business perspective. Outside of a couple of decent games, Xbox firstp party titles just aren't good. People are not going to be lining up to spend $80 on an Xbox game right now. You might get a handful, but not nearly as many as you're going to need. And it feels like every single time they go to pick up a publisher or a studio, they find a way to ruin it in one way, shape, or form. Except for Activision Blizzard King. And well, you can't necessarily ruin what is already effectively video game Satan. So there you go. You don't have the faith of the wide vast majority of players that play video games today. You are the weakest of the three platform holders. You are years behind in console sales and you're increasing prices across the board. What are you doing? I know what you're doing. You're terrified because Xbox, like all of these other companies, have built their castles on sand and because of rising development costs, because you guys consolidated your industries overseas and now are threatened by tariffs because piracy is on the rise. Because indie developers are putting out breakout hits because the EU Commission is now targeting microtransactions. The tide is coming in and you're all about to be washed out. Initially through GameStop, Xbox announced price hikes across the board, increasing the price of digital games up to $80 starting next year and increasing the price of their hardware and accessories anywhere from 20 to 30 to even charging $729 for the Xbox Series X2 TBTE console. more expensive than the PlayStation 5 Pro. Pricing yourself higher than your competition who's out selling you three to one is a bold strategy and not one that I was expecting. At the end of my Oblivion video, I had said, \"I don't trust these companies to make smart choices, and I hate being right.\" At first, I thought Xbox was pricing the Oblivion remaster at $50 as a direct response to Nintendo increasing their prices and dropping their Zelda remaster at $90. And honestly, I still think it was. Aspen Gold nailed it on Twitter. He said that 2025 and 2026 will be the years of remasters and remakes. Cheap to create compared to a new game, quantifiable existing audience, boost visibility for upcoming titles. Gears of War, Eay, little to no risk of controversy or boycott. Literally the easiest W in the industry right now. Honestly, I cannot believe that this guy can find time to post industry insights while also doing home improvement. But honestly, he's not wrong, especially when that remaster is as transformative as Oblivions, and especially if it's priced fairly. New releases are a minefield right now, plagued by creative missteps, content that nobody asked for, and player backlash. So, returning to the past makes sense. Players want something familiar, something proven. Reviving these beloved games with modern upgrades is a great way to answer that call while avoiding any backlash that's been plaguing a lot of these new IPs and modern releases. Though Oblivion censorship has raised some eyebrows, but the part that has been glossed over, the part that deserves a little bit more attention here is that this isn't just a visibility boost. It's Xbox clawing back into relevance. These aren't just nostalgic remasters. These are cultural recall grenades. And with the $40 Gears of War remaster, seemingly aiming at the exact same level of quality as the Oblivion one, Xbox has found a strategy that actually makes sense. Cost effective, highquality reminders of what the brand used to be and used to stand for. These games aren't locked behind exclusivity either. They're multiplatform, meaning that Xbox gets to reintroduce itself to players they've either lost or never had. And I'll be honest, I think this is smart. But here's the problem. It completely undercuts their justification for the price hikes everywhere else. Let's be real, Xbox is the last company that should be selling $80 games. Their recent titles have not earned it. When I think of an $80 game, I could maybe spend that on Elden Ring, Balders's Gate 3, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, Armored Core 6, games that gave me something complete, something real. I'm not thinking Halo Infinite, Avowed, or Starfield. And sure, that's subjective, but it's also about standards. Larian, Warhorse, From Software. They're not milking players through microtransactions. They're not nickel and dimming people with battle passes and halfbaked launches. They sell you a game. That's it. Now, Xbox, on the other hand, survives off of the back of Call of Duty microtransactions and reoccurring subscription revenue. Their games have not hit. Their platform sales are down. And now, with the excuse of Nintendo increasing their prices to $80, opening the floodgates, Xbox is the first in line to raise their prices across the board. Games, hardware, all of it. It doesn't feel strategic. It feels desperate. I mean, just last year, Phil Spencer said that raising prices beyond $70 could become manipulative. In his words, we went through co we found more ways of getting more money per player. I think that at some point you reach the peak of that and frankly it could go to places that are manipulative and I'm not a big fan of that. Then Microsoft would then go on to record $94 billion in profit. They would then double their growth. Their valuation hits 3.4 trillion and suddenly we are expected to believe that they have to increase prices because of rising development costs and economic uncertainty. Snakes in the grass slither fast. I said this in my Oblivion video and I'm going to say it again. Xbox may be the weakest platform right now, but that's exactly what makes them the most dangerous. With Game Pass and cross-platform releases, they can undercut their competition on their competition's own platforms. But instead of using that power to offer better value, they're just hiking their prices like everyone else. They issued a statement saying, \"We understand that these changes are challenging and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development. Sure, careful consideration until you realize the whole thing is just them passing the buck to the players. You know, everybody wants to pin these price hikes on the US trade war. And while that might be an agitator, I'm not buying it. Xbox is behind in the console race. You really don't think that there isn't a stockpile of unsold hardware somewhere? That Xbox that you're buying off the shelf right now wasn't made yesterday. It was made months ago. If these tariffs were such a serious issue, they could just slow down production, stagger the releases. Hell, with the profits that they're pulling in, they could eat the costs and not even feel it. But they won't because tariffs are just a convenient scapegoat. And even if they were rescended tomorrow, these prices would stay the exact same. What absolutely drives me up the wall is how transparent this whole thing is. These price hikes are a direct consequence of poor planning. Rising costs wouldn't be a factor if you hadn't bet your entire hardware operation in one country. If it wasn't for tariffs, it would have been something else. Supply chain failure, political unrest, a factory fire. These are self-inflicted wounds. So why is this happening? Why are all of these companies hiking their prices, slashing jobs, and trying to gaslight us into thinking it's all for our benefit? Well, the real answer is investor pressure. That's it. Gaming has become a hotbed for investors. It's not like traditional industries. Once hardware is out of the way, it's pure margin for the most part. No factories, no trucks, no physical goods, just code. And once they got your attention, they can sell you the exact same pixels over and over again. That's what they're protecting. Not the cost of development, but the rate of return. Live service games have become the golden goose in this industry. Infinite growth, infinite spend. You don't need to sell a game anymore. You sell a lifestyle. Look at Take Two. Their entire business is propped up by two things. GTA Online and NBA 2K's microtransaction economies. EA the same thing. FC, formerly FIFA, Madden, Apex Legends, three live service ecosystems that print money daily. Activision Blizzard, the only reason that they were worth $70 billion for Microsoft was because of World of Warcraft and Call of Duty. No innovation, no creativity, just predictable revenue. And it's that predictable revenue that has completely warped the conversation around development costs. We keep hearing about how games are more expensive to make than ever. But what they won't say out loud is they are the ones who made it that way. You do not get to cry poor after making billions of dollars in revenue, hiring thousands of people across a dozen studios, scaling up to unsustainable sizes, and then acting shocked when your overhead crushes your margins. GTA 6 is the perfect example. That game is taking longer to develop than every GTA combined. That's not because of creative ambition. It's because the machine behind it has become bloated, inefficient, and addicted to scale. That's not spending smarter. That's spending more. And they're expecting us to pay for it. What makes this all the more frustrating is that this industry is not struggling. Not even close. The last 30 years have been defined by record-breaking profits year over year over year. Xbox just had its best year ever. None of these companies are tightening their belts. Their executives aren't taking pay cuts. There's no scaledback bonuses, just mass layoffs and price hikes because they want to keep the party going at the top while cutting off everything else or just making you pay for it. And that's the thing that they don't want you guys to think about. This isn't about inflation. It's not about tariffs. It's not about rising development costs. It's about control. Xbox wants these price hikes. Ooh, they want them badly because if they can make traditional gaming so financially exhausting, $80 games, $700 consoles, $100 accessories, so they can herd their players towards services that they can control. Live service games, free-to-play, game pass, cloud gaming, controlled storefronts, closed ecosystems, the long game. They're just trying to boil the frog. These guys aren't even competing with each other anymore. It's so transparent. Microsoft buys Activision for $69 billion. Sony buys Bungie for 3.6 million. These aren't random events. These are symptoms of a market consolidating so aggressively that there is no pressure to undercut each other. No official collusion, just a shared understanding that if they all raise prices together, the customer will have nowhere else to go. And the worst part is they're doing it like it's going to benefit the industry in some way. They blame global instability, rising costs, economic pressure, but they're just using it as a smoke screen to justify whatever their next gamble is. the next experiment. All of it, every last move, is designed to shift the cost of their mistakes onto you. This isn't a strategy. It's survival. It's desperation that's dressed up in a suit and tie. And the more they raise the floor, the more players are going to start looking for the exit. Man, Xbox really love that quote from Ubisoft. Players need to get comfortable not owning their games. They thought to themselves, that's a strategy. That's a plan we can get behind. Let's make the market so uncomfortable for players to own anything, to own games or to own hardware that the lowincome and middle inome customers are likely to take the bait and go for Game Pass or go for cloud gaming or any of these other subscription services because why would I pay $80 when I could pay $20 a month and play all of these games rather than just get one little measly game? I mean, these services are so fair. They're so cheap. They're so effective until next year or the year after that where because of rising development costs and economic uncertainty, the price has to go up by 10 or $15. But don't worry because just like Netflix, we have an option for you price sensitive customers. Game Pass Basic with ads, PlayStation Plus Basic with ads, Ubisoft Basic with ads. Then after that, they're going to start selling you frame rates and resolution. We've seen this happen before. Like, I don't understand how people think that this isn't going to happen. I've had people push back on it. That's not what's going to happen. What are you stupid? You deserve to You deserve to pay these prices. Gaming is slowly being monetized into a hellscape like every other industry that's out there. And it's all to attract more investors. Notice how every single year they have to break record profits higher and higher and higher and higher without ever trying to lower their floor. The funny thing is this isn't like any other industry. We have options. We can go anywhere else that we want to. Hell, we're not even buying most of your games to begin with. I don't think that they understand how much trouble that they're in right now because one, I don't even think players are going to buy into this. I'm sure that there's going to be some people that are going to hop on the train and some of these bigger games that are going to come out that we know for a fact are actually good and if it's $80, people will still pay for it. But for the most part, when I talk to other people about these price changes, when I see my YouTube comments or I see things that people say on Twitter, it's apathy more than anything else. They don't care. Okay, I wasn't going to buy it anyway. That's the attitude that I'm seeing. I mean, all of this price pressure that we're seeing right now is coming from AAA, which nobody's really buying right now. Sure, a couple of those games are doing well, but the vast majority of them are not. Why would I want to spend $80 to play Fable next year when I could use that money to buy two Expedition 33s? Doesn't make any sense. You know, the worst part is they need to charge a lot more than $80 because the EU is about to pull the rug right out from underneath these guys. You know what I find interesting? Players aren't yelling anymore. Not like they used to. We've been through the same outrage cycle so many times that the tone is shifted when people are talking about $80 games or $700 consoles now. It's not anger, it's apathy. The reaction isn't don't do this to us. It's go ahead and destroy yourselves. I think that's where I am with a lot of this right now. I find their missteps to be more entertainment than their games are anymore. The bad games, the price hikes, the censorship, the controversy. Sitting back and watching PlayStation continue to chase the live service ghost as Marathon and Arc Raiders drop their alpha tests. right next to each other and the contrast between the two couldn't be any more glaring. Marathon losing players every single day. Their alpha was out while Ark Raiders kept growing. One game feeling like it's going to be the next big thing and the other one feeling like a trendchaser that's trying to fit in with the cool kids. Again, another game being made by a studio with half of the amount of developers. The highest levels of this industry have become so disconnected and so corporatized that they are blind to what players want. They think that our complaints are nothing more than whining. They listen to their board of directors or their sensitivity training. They're more worried about their next earnings call than the customers. We've become the last thing on their minds. And when you ignore us, we start to ignore you, your games, your platforms. Eventually, all of it becomes a symbol for everything that people don't want or want to support. So, we start going somewhere else. And that's exactly what's happening right now. I mean, the three highest player rated games of this year so far are Expedition 33, Blueprints, and Split Fiction. All of them launched at $50 or less. Split Fiction just passed 4 million copies sold. Expedition 33 hit 2 million copies sold in 2 weeks. Games made with a fraction of the money in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the developers providing exponentially more creativity and enjoyment. These aren't flukes. These are signals, and they're being ignored. These publishers are still operating like it's 2016, thinking that a massive budget, cinematic trailers, and a big IP is enough to be able to capture everybody's attention. But markets have changed. Markets do change. Just look at the top games on Steam right now. Most of them are cheap, old or indie. Outside of Balders's Gate 3, it's almost impossible to find a fullpriced game that has cracked the top 10 for longer than a week. That's why these price hikes just don't make any sense to me. A study last year showed that nearly 60% of all play time was spent in games that are more than 6 years old. The only new titles that have seemed to be able to break through are either free-to-play, higheffort indie titles that are priced fairly, or massive AAA projects that actually deliver what players are looking for, like Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Blackmth Wukong, or Space Marine 2. So, while these companies keep tightening their grip, pushing subscription models, raising base prices, and padding every single experience with battle passes and microtransactions, they're missing the bigger picture, the model they're chasing is already collapsing. I mean, take a look at highbudget movies and streaming services right now. The same industries that these guys are trying to emulate are already burning out. Just last year, PC Magazine published a report showing that internet piracy is on the rise again, up 36% from 2020. Why? Because content is fragmented across multiple services, prices keep going up and value keeps going down. Does that sound familiar to you guys at all? According to the study, piracy sites received 141 billion visits in the last year alone. That's more than the height of COVID lockdowns. The US leads the charge in piracy traffic. And it's not just movies and television anymore. It's games, too. Because when you lock all that content behind six different pay walls and continue to raise the prices, well, people don't get mad. They just find another way. So audiences today are either avoiding these products altogether or they're subverting the system to be able to find them for cheap or for free, making all these highbudget projects nearly impossible to find a profit in. But that's okay, right? Because I mean, they still have all that microtransaction income to be able to fall back on. Well, I wouldn't be too sure of that. Over the last few months, the European Union has ramped up its efforts to clamp down on what they call predatory monetization practices in gaming. All stemming from complaints about a mobile game called Star Stable Online. But it's quickly ballooned into something much bigger. The EU is now investigating the use of dark patterns, FOMOdriven events, psychological currency obuscation, and the lack of return policies for in-game purchases. If these rules go into effect, and there is growing pressure to make this law, it won't just affect mobile games. It will impact everything. And I can already hear the counterargument for this. They'll just make a different version of the game for other regions. But that's not going to happen. That's not how modern global releases work anymore. Look how every gotacha game or every RPG now shows its drop rates and its gotcha rates. And that's all based on a law from China. It tends to not really be worth the effort or the cost to manage different versions of the game. And plus, on top of that, their motivations to make a different version of the game would be so transparent that it would beg litigation. I'm telling you right now, if a return policy becomes mandatory in one region, it's going to be implemented everywhere. And that alone could shatter the very foundation of this entire microtransaction economy. Because these purchases are not made out of value. They are made out of impulse. They are emotional, compulsive, dopamine-driven decisions designed to wear off quickly. That's what they want them to do. And if you give people a few hours to reconsider and refund those purchases, the entire system collapses. And that's not hyperbole. Keep in mind the most biggest publishers in this industry, EA, Take 2, Microsoft, Sony, Epic, they are all held up by this model. Anything that could disrupt the balance of it would threaten to break the entire thing. Right now, most of the industry's revenue isn't coming from games. It's coming from that ecosystem. Epic has Fortnite. EA has FC. Apex Legends and Madden. Microsoft has Call of Duty. Nintendo is pulling in billions from the Pokemon titles. And Sony, well, we already know they've been desperately trying to chase live service games for years. But this is the only path they have. This is their only path to growth. This is the only path that investors understand. And without them, they're nothing. In 2025 alone, Microsoft's content and services revenue went up by 8%. Not because of great new games that they had released, but because of subscriptions and microtransactions. When they acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, their overall gaming revenue jumped by 49%. content and services, meaning reoccurring payments and microtransactions, grew by 61%, consuming the vast majority of their earnings. If the European Union cracks down on digital currencies and dark patterns, and other countries continue to regulate things like loot boxes and gambling and video games, it's not just going to be a bad quarter, it's going to be a market reset. And most of these companies have nothing of substance to be able to fall back on. I'm going to be honest with you guys. I think one of the only reasons that we haven't seen any big moves towards regulation of microtransactions is because of the complete economic collapse that it would cause in the gaming industry. These guys have built their entire businesses around being able to psychologically manipulate their audience and extract as much reoccurring revenue as possible. And they've done it while constantly scaling up their companies to absurd proportions, adding more developers, more marketing, and more money. And they've gotten used to this arrangement. The industry is wildly underregulated, which is exactly why it's grown so fast and attracted so much outside capital. But that gold rush is coming to an end. Because if consumer protection start forcing these companies to act ethically or even transparently, the entire business model falls apart. And of course, things are only getting worse for these guys. Because add to the fact that one of their hidden revenue streams just got unraveled. Ubisoft is currently under legal fire for allegedly harvesting behavioral data through their online only single player games and likely their multiplayer games as well. That's why these guys wanted us to be online all the time. Data that they can analyze, sell, and use to manipulate the players all without ever asking for permission. This is what the modern gaming industry is built on right now. Addiction loops, monetization funnels, data mining, and psychological manipulation that's disguised as entertainment. And now that that's all starting to collapse, under regulatory pressure, under consumer fatigue, under the weight of a leaner, smarter, and more successful indie scene, these guys are panicking. They're raising their prices. They're pushing subscriptions even harder. They're throttling features and slapping payw walls on content that used to be free. I mean, it's now rumored that Call of Duty is going to start to paywall their events and gameplay modes. I'm telling you right now, this isn't going to work because the players that used to be there aren't going to be fooled anymore. And the ones that do care have already walked away. And the ones that are still there aren't going to be enough. I think I might have brought this up before, but they keep trying to treat this industry like it's every other industry, which makes a lot of sense because a lot of these CEOs are coming from other places than gaming. But it's just not how this beast is built. It's just not how it works. It's the psychology of the whole thing. It's how people interact with these products. We don't even think of them as products. We think of them as games. We think of them as experiences. We think of them as worlds that we're visiting, as memories that we are having, as memories that we are sharing, ones that we plan on returning to or may return to in the future or whatever it might be. And we play these games, we don't consume them. And that's a completely different interaction than you see in a lot of other industries. And I think that they've lost touch with that. And I think that's more evident by the day, to be honest with you. They left the players behind. They've been making worse games. They've been trying to monetize them even further. And even if they can make a good game, it's likely too expensive for us to buy or it's too expensive for them to make. I mean, look at how high these guys have risen the stakes for themselves. Grand Theft Auto 6 is estimated to be $2 billion in development costs. That is insane. You cannot keep up with that. You can't even compete with that. effectively to just make what the AAA industry is supposed to be making in the first place. They have to sell like 30 plus million copies to be able to break even after fees and things like that on other platforms. They can pull that off, but the vast majority of the industry doesn't stand a chance. Are you kidding me? But these are the costs that continue to rise. They keep doing this to themselves. They keep scaling up and scaling out and they use subscription services and microtransactions to be able to offset that growth and show that perpetual record-breaking growth that they need to to show to their shareholders because most of these CEOs are paid in stock options to begin with that never take pay cuts, by the way, regardless of how many people they lay off or how bad their business does. notice most of these gaming CEOs never lose their job, you know, and with the subscription services, I don't think I think it's going to be around. I think it's going to stick around, but I don't think it's ever going to be as popular as these companies are hoping it's going to be. They want it to be because it's the best and the most control that they'll ever be able to have over their consumer base. But I just think that people want to have their library. I think they want to have their games that they can go back to. I think they like buying things when they're on sale. People like feeling like they're getting a deal on something and people just want their games. Physical copies of games still sell. Expedition 33's physical copies sold out in multiple countries. And with microtransactions, that entire ecosystem is built on psychology, manipulation. They have to manipulate the player to be able to get that money. And if that is disrupted in any way, if there is legislation against it that gets rid of dark patterns or gets rid of anything, these guys are cooked. They won't stand a chance. You will see companies that you never thought would go out of business go out of business overnight. Honestly, I can't wait to watch it all backfire. It has been so much fun to sit back and watch as these indie companies have just been running circles around these guys lately. It has been crazy. The amount of just random out of nowhere developers making tons of money, making games that are incredibly popular and absolutely beloved, it has just been so much fun. And keep in mind, you know, for every copy of Expedition 33 that sells, that's one less copy of Assassin's Creed that gets sold. These companies do directly compete with their games, even though they don't like to compete on their prices in a lot of cases, at least not on the AAA side, but that's how this whole thing works. So, you know, they hate to see it. They'll act like they're happy to see these guys do well. I was talking to an indie developer the other day and he had said that because of the direction that the industry is headed in, it has created so many opportunities for these guys to make money and they are so happy that these guys keep self-sabotaging themselves. He's like, \"It has never been better to be an indie dev.\" I told him, \"You guys are making it or it's never been better to be a gamer.\" So, hope you guys enjoyed the video. If you guys did enjoy the video, subscribe to the channel, comment down below, like the video, share the video, and come follow me on Twitch. I'll be streaming today, actually. So, yeah. Stay cool, stay righteous, stay safe. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace. Family. Family.",
